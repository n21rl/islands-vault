## Intro
The party just executed a daring prison break, freeing Esmith from prison. She seems to hold a grudge towards Yazim for abandoning her, but also leaving his crew and family behind. Yazim tried to visit his parents but they weren't at the same address. 
The party also freed a pirate captain of the Republic, Calico Jack. Lou Beluga is hiding Calico Jack and Esmith in a secret cellar in the Undercity, under the bar of his inn. Called The White Straw Hat, Lou's establishment is located on an artificial beach on the bank of Ben's canal. It can be a place of relaxation or intense partying, depending on the owner's mood. It is the place where you are currently staying. The flashy escape of two prisoners has affected the city's atmosphere. The party noticed that guards are on high alert, carrying frequent stops and occasional searches. While not as intolerant of magic as Steorr, the Sibl√≠n Guilds treat it as a potential weapon. Its use is heavily regulated by individual guilds and the Board. Lou therefore warned the adventurers to be discreet during their stay.

Yazim:
I think while Yazim is laying low, he would like to try find out what happened to his parents and brother, and also try get back in Esmith's good books if somehow possible lol 
And then maybe they could investigate the Wessons together

DM:
You follow Lou's instructions and walk behind the bar of the White Straw Hat. Moving an old dusty bottle reveals a small door camouflaged amongst the drinks that swings open, opening to a narrow staircase that leads down to the cellar. Climbing down, you find yourself in a low-ceilinged room lit by a few lanterns, with two cots, a table, a chair, and a shelf with a few supplies. 
Calico Jack is sitting on the chair, his feet on the table and a book in his hands. He's wearing a white shirt and deep green trousers. Nonchalantly flipping through the book, he looks like he owns this place, but also like he is bored of it. He peers up at you when you enter. 
Esmith is lying on one of the cots, wearing simple clothes that look baggy on her small frame. Framed by her dark hair, her face looks even paler than you remember. She sits up and stares at you with a cold expression, and says "What do you want?"
