## Intro
I am running a text sidequest with Carolinn, who plays Rena.

DM: 
You arrive at the Eólas Library, a large domed building that stands out among the crowded and colourful streets of Áine. 
Walking under the portico, you enter the library and find yourself in a wide hall. To the your left and right, multiple aisles of shelves reach up all the way to the painted dome, filled with books and scroll tubes. Between them, long tables with chairs allow people to read and study. You can smell the scent of paper, ink, and leather. The place is very quiet and only the sound of pages turning, quills scratching, soft walking and whispering break the silence. 
In the distance, you notice corridors and stairs that branch off from the hall, leading to other areas labelled with signs: history, geography, art, magic, experiments, etc. Some areas seem to be guarded by staff who check credentials. 
Mechanical servants are walking around the aisles. Similar in appearance to Thin Lizzie from the Pirate Republic, they are made of metal and wood, with moving gears and springs. They seem to follow a precise and efficient pattern, sorting books on the shelves or carrying them on carts. 
In front of you, you see a reception desk, where a young woman with glasses and a neat bun is sitting. She looks looks busy with a piece of parchment, but quite friendly. You wonder if you should approach her or explore the Eólas Library on your own.

Carolinn:
I decide I don't want to bother the young woman at the desk while she's working, so I'll have a look around on my own first, thinking I can always go back to her if I need any help.
I start out just exploring the library, not looking for anything specific, I'm just taking it all in and feeling at home here. I want to see if I can find any books on topics like cartography and sailing that might help me once we're back at sea or books about the Siblíns and their guilds as they still feel very mysterious. But while I'm strolling around, I try to keep an eye on the magic section, just to figure out if lots of people enter it or if it's one of the guarded areas (keeping Lou's advice in mind).

DM:
Can you please give me an Investigation check to find the books you're interested in? Also a Perception check to keep an eye on the magic section

Carolinn:
Rolled a 25 Investigation
Rolled a 16 Perception

DM:
You find quite a few books and scrolls on the topics you are interested it. Ladders allow you to grab the volumes places on higher shelves.
You find a comfortable chair in a quiet spot that allow you to keep an eye on other sections of the library. There, you can spend several hours studying.
You learn a lot about navigation and cartography. You gain proficiency with the [Navigator's Tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/navigators-tools).
You also learn about the Siblíns themselves. The three city-islands of Aíne, Ben, and Cad were named after three siblings who supposedly founded the country. Even though facts about them are disputed, they are important cultural or even religious figures. The Siblín society values craftsmanship, innovation, and trade. It is divided into various specialized guilds, who oversee specific trades. Guild membership is mandatory for all workers. The supreme ruling body is the Board of the Guilds, an assembly where seats are allocated to guilds based on by tax contributions.
As you read, you see that the magic section receives a few visitors who have to show their guild credentials to the guards to gain access. You also notice mechanical servants wheeling carts out of the magic section and the adjoining section marked "Experimental". They seem to be heading down corridor bearing a "Disposal" sign. The carts are holding tattered books and scrolls, as well as damaged machine parts.

Carolinn:
Can I look down the corridor marked "Disposal" at all  to see what they are doing with those things?

DM:
Not really from where you're sitting, but it seems to lead down to a lower level
