## Intro
I am running a text sidequest with Wyveria, who plays Gurt. Before the party gained entry to the Sibl√≠ns through the merchant Sable Martes, Gurt had applied to the Woodcarver's Guild with the hope that they would vouch for him. He whittled a wooden a bird and infused it with the ability to sing and submitted it as a sample of his work.

## Chat log 
DM:
It's been a few days since you submitted your sample to the Woodcarver's Guild but you still have not heard back. You assume they might be busy, but when you happened to walk by their guild house, it seemed to be a rather small building, with not much activity inside. A paper note on the door read "Away for lunchtime", despite it being the middle of the afternoon. As you marvel at the craftsmanship of the T√∫ram, gazing at its various dials from below, you notice a small reinforced door at its base. A metal plaque reads "AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY" and in smaller lettering below "Clockwork Guild" with a symbol of a gear. 

Wyveria:
Does Gurt know from chatting with Sable whether it is possible to apply for multiple guilds?

DM:
Yes, definitely possible. Although some guilds might see membership in another guild as a downside, split loyalties and all

Wyveria:
If I apply to the Clockwork Guild for example, can I turn down acceptance into the Woodcarver's guild, even it I get in? Seems like no one is processing my application for this guild anytime soon

DM:
For sure, yes. You probably would have to go through some kind of interview/assessment anyway

Wyveria:
Ok, Gurt will go find the Clockwork Guild and look to submit an application I'd like to carve a small delicate bird that's able to flap its wings and open its mouth, And then through magical tinkering it's able to sing a small tune when it opens its mouth, Also if I go in person hopefully they will examine Godfrey

DM:
Give me an Investigation check to find their guild house. And an Intelligence check + proficiency bonus to see how good your creation is

Wyveria:
Rolled a 7 Investigation. 

Wyveria:
Rolled a 9 Crafting. 

Wyveria:
Fk üòÇ
Well, I hope Godfrey is impressive

DM:
Haha well you have a week in √Åine. So I'll let you reroll if you want, until Gurt is happy with his creation, at the cost of one day per roll. Right now you would be on day 3 I think (arrival day, second day in prison, today)

Wyveria:
Ok sounds good

DM:
I'll also tell you now you couldn't find the guild on your own this first day. You can also do a reroll for that each new day, but it will become easier

DM:
Let me know if you want to do anything different on day 4 or just give me your new Investigation and Crafting rolls üòä

Wyveria:
Rolled a 6 Investigation 

Wyveria:
Rolled a 20 Crafting 

Wyveria:
Haha, don't know if I found the guild, but
looks like the bird is improving

DM:
Jesus Christ, Gurt are you okay?

Wyveria:
üòÇ

Wyveria:
He's been away from big cities for awhile I take it he still doesn't find the guild?

DM:
Not today! Another try?

Wyveria:
On the 5th day he will try asking Yazim or his contacts for directions first

DM:
Roll investigation with advantage

Wyveria:
Rolled a 17

DM:
You walk around the whole morning, asking people about the Clockwork Guild, but no luck. You find yourself lost for a time, before realising you are just around the corner from the White Straw Hat. After you make your way back to the inn,you ask Lou for directions. He happens to know a customer who works for the Clockwork Guild. He draws a detailed map for you to find their guild house and recommends you use a shortcut through ones of the passages of the Sidecity. 
He also lets you know a message arrived for you. It is a note scribbled on cheap paper, inviting you to the meet the head of the Woodcarver's Guild. 

Wyveria:
Is there a time on the invitation? 

DM:
No time, just "today"

Wyveria:
Gurt will head over to the Woodcarver's Guild, and see if it is open today

DM:
You make your way to the guild house that you found two days prior. It is a modest building, where the only extravagance is the expertly carved wooden lintel above the door. You knock and a plump gnome comes to greet you. He is wearing a simple apron over his clothes, and you spot some wood shavings on his shoulders. He greets you warmly and introduces himself as Fiddlesticks and says they've been expecting you. He hands you a cup of tea and invites you to sit down while you wait for Master Carver Madera. You look around you at the shelves lined with a multitude of intricately carved figurines.
About twenty minutes later, a door opens to your right and a older elven woman invites you in. Her silver hair is in a bun and she wears a necklace of carved wooden beads. You enter her office which also seem to be a workshop, with tools and half-done projects everywhere. She smiles and says "Welcome to our guild house Gurt, I'm Madera. I have seen your work and I must say I am impressed. Apologies we couldn't see you earlier, our membership is dwindling and we do not have a lot of staff here. Please, tell me why you would like to join."

Wyveria:
Gurt tips his head in acknowledgement and greeting. "I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me. To be candid, I'm a crew member of a merchant trading vessel that has newly arrived to Ain√©. Our captain hopes that if our trading is fruitful here we will make future return trips to the Sibl√≠ns. I'm a shipwright by trade, but an artist at heart, and felt selling my wares through the Woodcarver's guild would be a way of making some of my own coin while in the Sibl√≠ns. However as a newcomer to town, please forgive me for not knowing the specific business of the Woodcarver's guild. I would love to hear more about the guild while here today."

DM:
She seems a bit surprised but she smiles and says :
"Oh, that's an interesting idea. Usually, travellers do not apply to guilds. You see, joining a guild is not a trivial matter. It is essentially becoming a citizen of the Sibl√≠n nation. Apart from a few cases, most people live on one of our islands. Like them, you would have to abide by our customs and laws. That includes paying guild dues and following guild standards. In exchange, you would enjoy access to our support, resources, training, contacts, and buisness opportunities. Our members are independent but get a say in how we run the guild. Most guilds work in a similar way here." She seems to recognise you might not understand how things work in the Sibl√≠ns and she speaks without condescension. 
"If you joined us, you would be part of a community of people who share your passion for woodcarving. Ours is an old guild, if a bit small. We resisted being absorbed by the Builders and Artists Guilds, among others. We carve anything from furniture to toys, from statues to musical instruments. We use various types of wood, some of them rare and exotic. We pride ourselves on our craftsmanship and creativity.
Based on your bird, I can tell that you have similar values. How did you enchant it? It is remarkable!"

Wyveria:
"Appreciate your patience and the explanation, I think it's definitely something for me to think about then. I don't think my seafaring days are over quite yet. But I'm not much an enchanter, I just have a keen eye for how different parts interact. All though I will admit the feathers were a lucky accident." (Is she referring to Godfrey, or the eagle Gurt carved?) Gurt proceeds to give a high level overview of tuning wood fibres to vibrate at the current voice frequency, allowing Godfrey to respond appropriately depending on what Gurt instructs, and also various sensors to detect intention and allow Godfrey to protect himself. (Alternatively he gives a similar explanation about the eagle if that's what she was asking about) 

DM: 
I realise we haven't talked about what you would do with Godfrey. I imagined her asking about the carved eagle, but if you have Godfrey with you, she definitely would ask similar questions about him. Regardless, I think this would be a Deception roll, as we've established Gurt's craft is a little bit more than purely physical

Wyveria:
Sorry I thought the idea of how Gurt does magic is like a very complicated science, the description above is him being honest about his process.
But I can alter to include that he is able to carve arcane sigils/etc

DM:
Right, sorry for the confusion! I think Gurt can see what he does as very complex science where he manipulates the physical world in his own way. But in this world, it qualifies as manipulating magical energy, in lore and mechanics. It doesn't have to include sigils or any traditionally arcane things if you don't want that though. Does that make sense? (edited)   
Would you have brought Godfrey then?

Wyveria:
Sounds good! And yes, Godfrey will go where Gurt goes

DM:
Cool! Can you please give me a Persuasion check then?

Wyveria:
Rolled a 3

Wyveria:
Welp

DM:
She listens to your explanation and calmy says: "Gurt, I can recognise masterful carving and this is definitely it. But it's also something more, whether you realise it or not. Our guild would surely benefit from your membership, but I wouldn't be surprised if others courted you for your skills. Be careful who you end up working with."

Wyveria:
"Glad to have your honesty, I'll talk it over with my crew and captain, and let you know my decision before we head out"
Does she have anything more to day before Gurt leaves?

DM:
As you get ready to leave, Madera hesitates a moment but adds "Just so you know, the authorities seem to have taken an interest in bird contraptions recently. I'm sure you've been an upstanding visitor, but I thought this might be of interest to you..."

Wyveria:
"That's strange, why birds specifically? Are they looking for devices for reconnaisance?"

DM:
"I'm not sure, it sounds like a crime was committed by perpetrators using birds or bird-like machines. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"


(In the couple days on the bigger island has Gurt heard any rumours at the tavern/walking around about the jail break?)

DM:  
(You know guards have been conducting stops and searches. No mention of a jail break though)

Wyveria:  
"Huh, is that why those guards have been working so hard around here lately? I just thought that was normal procedure in these parts. But from you is the first time I'm hearing about this bird crime. It's good to know though, would hate to get caught up in whatever is going on cause I like to carve birds."

DM:
Give me a Deception check please

Wyveria:    
Technically all true!
The best kind of true !

DM:
Hahaha well you haven't heard about the bird crime, but you certainly were involved in it

Wyveria:
Rolled a 4

Wyveria:
Also I hate this app
Or rather I think it hates me

DM:  
Without loosing her quiet demeanour, she says "Legal protection is also a service that guilds may offer, you know"

Wyveria:
"That's certainly helpful, I have a lot of respect for a guild that protects its members."

DM:
She lets you know that the guild will keep your eagle as a model for students. She thanks you for coming by hopes that you'll consider joining. Anything else you'd like to do?

Wyveria:
How many more days do we have? 

DM:
This is the morning of day 5, you said you'd leave on day 7. But there's always the possibility of asking for an extension of your permission your stay
 
Wyveria: 
I think most of the time here I lay low and act like a regular shipwright. Go to taverns, get drinks, shop a bit

-----

DM:
Your companions and yourself have been busy around town and you haven't seen much of the others. You know that Rena visited the library, that Yazim descended to the cellar to talk to his friend Esmith, and that Kaihakan looked for tattooists, but not much else.

Three days before you are due to leave √Åine, Lou Beluga lets you know something arrived for you at the inn. He didn't see who left it, but he hands you a small cloth package secured with twine and a letter attached to it. The letter reads: 
"Dear Gurt, 

Your remarkable technological talents have not gone unnoticed among certain circles here in √Åine. Rather than joining a Guild with all the restrictions it entails, we have a unique position to present to you. 

It aligns perfectly with your abilities and would not only be highly profitable, but also allow you to explore mysteries at the frontiers of the physical and arcane worlds. We propose a meeting to discuss this further.

We have arranged for you to join a tour of the T√∫ram at midday tomorrow; your name is already on the list of authorized visitors. Should you chose to accept this meeting, please wear the enclosed item and our representative will approach you during the tour. Discretion is paramount, so please come unaccompanied. Should you refuse, please keep the item as a token of our admiration and forget you ever received this letter.

We hope you will consider this opportunity, it is a chance for you to be part of something much larger and more significant than you could ever dream of.

Sincerely,
Your friends in the Sibl√≠ns"

Inside the package, you find an intricate monocle made of finely polished crystal set in a delicate metal frame, with a sturdy yet lightweight metal chain that allows it to be attached to clothing for quick access.


Gigi:
Based on the intricacy of the monocle and Gurt's own recent exploration of the Sibl√≠ns, can he think of who might have sent this letter?


Gigi:
He will also examine it for magical properties


DM:
The glass itself seems very well crafted, so it could have been made by any member of the Glassmakers Guild, but no guarantee it was sent by them. The connection to the T√∫ram might indicate someone from the Clockwork Guild, and you know the Sages Guild studies technology and magic, but once again no certainty. Detect Magic, Identify, or an Arcana check might revel something about the monocle, depending on what you prefer to use


Gigi:
Gurt will take 10 minutes to prepare his examination tools to scan over the object. (He casts Identify)


DM:
As you examine the monocle, you realise that the glass is actually a complex set of enchanted lenses that allow you to enhance your visual abilities (https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4634-eyes-of-minute-seeing)


Gigi:
OOC: nice üòÑ

üòÅ 

Gigi:
Are any of the party members staying at the inn?


DM:
Everyone is. We can do a chat with everyone or wait till our session depending on what you want to do


Gigi:
Ok, Gurt would like to go to this meeting. I don't need to talk it out, but want to have messaged at least one person with the where and when, so that if I don't return by sundown people know where to start looking for me.


DM:
So you want to go on your own?


Gigi:
Yeah


DM:
OK! We'll say you messaged the others to let them know


DM:
Shortly before noon, as you make your way through the busy market square, the sun is high in the sky. It casts its rays over the T√∫ram, highlighting the intricate stonework and the myriad of dials that adorn the facade. 

A small group around the entrance to the tower seems to be buzzing with anticipation. A cheerful half-elf woman clad in red notices you approaching and addresses you "Ah, hello Sir! Are you our last named guest or do you wish to purchase a ticket to visit the marvel of √Åine?'' She's holding a piece of parchment and you assume she is the guide


Gigi:
"If Gurt's the last name in your list then that would be me."


Gigi:
(Gurt has also worn the monocle as instructed)


Gigi:
It's clipped on the front of his clothing


DM:
As you confirm your identity, the guide smiles broadly, checking your name off her list. "Excellent! You're just in time." 

She waves her feathered hat in the air. "Welcome everyone! My name is Seraphina and I'll be your guide today" she announces to the group enthusiastically. Among the visitors, you notice a young female elf dressed in colorful patterned clothing speaking in a foreign accent, an older erudite-looking male orc carrying a notebook, and a middle-aged man with a weathered face contrasting with his elegant deep blue garb. 

Midday comes and the largest bell of the T√∫ram rings loudly above you. Seraphina begins retelling the history of the T√∫ram, how it was built on the ashes of the old √Åine tower, bringing together the talents of many guilds. She points out the most signicant dials and their function. 

She leads you inside, where the cool air contrasts with the warmth outside. At the heart of the wide hall stands an impressive lift, encased in wrought iron, ascending majestically through the tower's core. In the back, a door left ajar reveals stone spiral staircases. You hear the constant humming of gears and magic. 

Seraphina guides you and the other visitors towards the various exhibits surrounding the lift. Scale models and magically animated illustrations detail the tower's history, architecture, and inner workings.


Gigi:
Gurt will listen attentively throughout the tour, but also keep an eye out for who his contact might be.


Gigi:
He doesn't attempt to make any small talk with the other guests.


DM:
(I'm going to sleep now, but I forgot to ask: did you bring Godfrey?)


Gigi:
Oh hmmm, does Godfrey still need to lie low after the escape?


Gigi:
If the furor has died down I bring him, if not he can stay back at the inn


DM:
There are still a lot of guards patrolling the streets and conducting searches


Gigi:
Okay, Godfrey will stay at the inn.


DM:
Sounds good!


DM:
As the tour progresses, Seraphina guides the group up the lift to various instrument rooms that gather information about the tides, winds, and other valuable data. Her cheerful voice echoing off the sturdy walls as she shares information about the tower's inner workings and history. 

The man dressed in blue listens carefully, particularly interested in the technologies related to sailing. From the way Seraphina addresses him, you gather he is an important person in √Åine. The orc occasionally interjects, often saying "More of a comment than a question...." and correcting factual inaccuracies in Seraphina's explanations, boasting his credentials as a historian from the Sages Guild. The guide responds politely, but you can sense her frustration. Initially enthusiastic, the young elf seems to have gotten bored. You can see her fidgeting, tapping her fingers together. As you get into the lift to head to the Core, the functional brain and heart of the T√∫ram, she leans towards you and whispers in an unusual accent "So what brings you here? Are you a local or a traveller like me?"

How does Gurt respond? 
Give me a Perception check as you enter the Core

Wyveria Request: `[1d20+4]` Roll: `[7]` Result: `11`


Gigi:
Gurt smiles back politely, "I'm from out of town, but hoping to ply my trade for coin while here.  And yourself? Are you an artisan?"


DM:
As the lift rumbles up, she responds "Oh no I'm just visiting, looking for adventure, finding a way to spend my inheritance! I'm c by the way". She seems genuinely excited to meet you. 

Seraphina turns a crank, the iron doors slide open, and you find yourselves in the Core. This monumental room contains more machinery that you have ever seen. The air is filled with the scent of metal and oil, and the rhythmic sounds of pistons and gears. Connected to the apparatus, crystal globes pulsating with magical light illuminate the room. On suspended metal walkways, several attendants dressed in practical work attire are meticulously inspecting and adjusting the mechanisms using small tools and oiling brushes.

As Seraphina starts explaining the significance of this chamber, Tolmiri leans towards you to chat some more. But you can't really hear what she's saying. Your head is suddenly buzzing with noise, as if every sound is the room was amplified tenfold. A searing pain goes across your temples.


DM:
Give me a wisdom saving throw please
What do you do?

I would also try and look around to see if I spot a caster.

It feels like a psychic effect. Give me a perception check to look for a caster

Guess that pain is distracting Gurt


Gigi:
Gurt will try and act like nothing happened


Gigi:
Nodding along to what Tolmiri is saying


DM:
You're vaguely aware of Tolmiri's voice stopping mid-sentence. The pain and the noise recede as quickly as they came, but Tolmiri noticed your demeanour changed "Are you zoning out? It happens to me all the time!"


DM:
Give me a performance check

Gigi:
Does Tolmiri look capable?


Gigi:
Ie. When they said they were looking for adventure, are they an Adventurer with a capital A


DM:
Give me a Perception check to study her appearance, or Insight for her demeanour, or another check you can justify


Gigi:
I'll do Perception

DM:
She nods along, satisfied with your explanation. It's difficult to make a clear assessment, but her outfit doesn't scream Adventurer; It's more extravagant than practical. You do notice she wears a pendant that Southern elves sometimes use for magic, but she might just like the way it looks


Gigi:
Gurt will keep going with the tour, but now on alert


DM:
The terribly painful noise starts again as Seraphina explains the role of the globes as energy sources. Give me another wisdom saving throw please

Wyveria Request: `[1d20+1]` Roll: `[17]` Result: `18`


Gigi:
Ok, I think Gurt has had enough of this


Gigi:
He's going to step slightly from the group and cast Pyrotechnics, the effect being smoke


Gigi:
20 feet of think black smoke fills up the area


Gigi:
Thick*


DM:
What's your target point? The room is quite large. The group, the mechanisms where the attendants are working? Are you included in the smoke?


DM:
I can draw a map quick if needed


Gigi:
Are there any mechanisms near us?


Gigi:
I would like to be covered by the smoke if possible, but want it to look plausible something has started to malfunction near us


DM:
Yeah you're quite close to mechanisms, so you could probably cover some people and mechanisms yeah


Gigi:
Kk, I'll do that


Gigi:
And then panickedly yell, Fire!


Gigi:
Where was the nearest exit?


DM:
There's the lift and the stairs, probably both 20 feet away


Gigi:
Do people start stampeding to leave?


DM:
Once again, the pain recedes quickly, and your mind is clear enough to carry out your subterfuge. Ones of the attendants  swiftly makes his way toward the smoke. He's a small Kobold with rusty red scales, bright eyes, and a nose scar. He screams "Everybody out, take the stairs please!"


Gigi:
Cool, while in the smoke and hubub, I use my Disguise Self spell from my tattoo and take on the generic form of a mechanic, before rushing out with the rest of the group.


Gigi:
Just confirming some of the other attendants are also leaving? If not I won't become one.


DM:
Give me a perception check


[29/11/2023 16:35] Dice Maiden#9678
Wyveria Request: `[1d20+4]` Roll: `[16]` Result: `20`


DM:
The Kobold that screamed to get out seems to be in charge, gesture to the others to leave as well, he waits by the door and you notice he doesn't seem that panicked. As you approach the stairs, he grabs your arm with his small hand "You, help me with the fire!" You notice he wears a monocle similar to yours attached to his overalls


Gigi:
Gurt will play along, and follow the Kobold. But also, as a bonus action I am casting Expeditious Retreat so that's ready in case I need it.


DM:
Once everyone has left, he says "Apologies for the headache Gurt, I was planning on bringing you to the infirmary. Your display was really unnecessary and risky! We can't have that in the future"


Gigi:
"You can give me a headache but not just send me a message? I thought I was under attack, not the first time someone has tried to steal secrets about my craft."


Gigi:
"Why all this subterfuge?"


DM:
(sorry, I forgot to say you took 5 and 3 damage from the effect)


DM:
‚ÄúApologies again, my technology is not as subtle as yours‚Äù he says with a hint of sarcasm, glancing at the smoke. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt intend to steal anything from you, but we could show you how we manipulate the very fibres of reality, and we could use your feedback. Would you follow me down the lift?‚Äù


Gigi:
"I would have been subtle if I didn't have cause to fear for my safety," Gurt replies. "But now that I'm here, how do I know I can trust you?"


DM:
"I understand your doubts, Gurt. Know that the benefits in knowledge and gold will outweigh any harm I have caused you. Our present was just an apetizer" he says, tapping the monocle


DM:
"See where we're coming from, we're unsure we can trust you as well, but it's a risk we are willing to take."


Gigi:
"Alright, I'll come with you for now. What should I call you?"


DM:
"You can call me Nixt" the Kodbold responds, gesturing you toward the lift. Inside, he produces a small key and inserts it into an inconspicuous slot, before deftly manipulating the switches and levers to operate the lift.  The machine starts its descent, which seems longer than it should be to return to the level of the market square. Nixt asks "So you have experience with creating items with interesting properties, but what about disassembling one?"


DM:
(Are you still disguised by the way?)


Gigi:
Yeah, I will stay disguised

{Reactions}
üëç 

Gigi:
No point stopping if he knows it's me


DM:
Makes sense!


Gigi:
"It's how a learned my trade, as I'm mostly self taught. Anything interesting that I came across in my travels I'd like to take apart and see how it ticks. Then I'd take what I saw and apply it to my own woodwork."


DM:
"Very interesting... That will come in handy" he smiles, as the lift descends deeper underground. It creaks loudly and comes to halt, revealing the underground control room: damp, cool, and dimly lit. Nixt steps out first, his keen eyes quickly scanning the room. He moves with purpose towards one of the walls. With a deft flick of his clawed fingers, he triggers a concealed mechanism. A large hidden stone door swings open, revealing a narrow, torch-lit tunnel that burrows deeper into the earth. "Welcome to the Undercity..." the Kobold says.

You follow him through several tunnels before eventually reaching a secluded modest-sized chamber. Shelves on the wall contain various small items and ingredients within jars. In the middle of the room lie a workbench cluttered with various tools, as well as a strange cubic device with a copper funnel aimed towards the work surface


Gigi:
Gurt takes in his surroundings. "Interesting place down here, why all the secrecy?"


DM:
"What you will learn here lies beyond the knowledge of any guild, or even the Board. It is not exactly tolerated by the weaker minds... Let me show you."

Nixt brings you to the workbench and places a pair of stitched boots similar to moccasins on it. A motif of a lion head with his mouth wide open is carved into the leather, with the fur around the collar resembling its mane. "These are infused with an enchantment. I would like you to dismantle them with minimal damage, and I'll show you the purpose of this device". He gently taps the mysterious box-shaped apparatus. "We need to be quick however, the others might wonder where you've gone".

If you accept this task, this is going to be a Skills Challenge. You will need to hit 5 successes before 3 failures. The DC is 15. You may use any Skill (or Tool or Ability) that you can justify, but not more than twice. You can also use Spells or Features and we can discuss how that would affect the Challenge. For the sake of efficiency, you can give me several rolls at a time, announcing what they are before. Just stop when you've hit 2 failures or 4 successes, so that I can prepare for what happens at the end!


Gigi:
Sure!


Gigi:
Can I start by ritual casting Identify? Gurt will want to know what he's working with


DM:
Sure! I would count this as both a success and a failure if that makes sense to you. You're learning a lot, but time is of the essence. Or you can burn the spell slot and that would be just an automatic success.
I'll give you the info either way


Gigi:
Oh I'll burn the spell slot then


DM:
Sounds good!


DM:
Roaring Lion Boots - These boots have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expand a charge as a bonus action to increase your walking speed by 30 feet and gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute. The boots regain 1d3 expended charges at dawn.


Gigi:
Alright, I'd like to use my skill in Arcana twice now, to examine the magical bindings, and work out to take take the physical properties apart without ruining the spellwork

Gigi:
I have proficiency in Tinker's Tools, I would like to start taking apart the boots using them, using Gurt's knowledge from his examination


Gigi:
Let me know if I can use Int, or if I have to use Dex


DM:
You study the boots in details, working out that the integrity of the boots is linked to their magical properties. If even one of them stops being usable as a shoe, or if the lion stops being recognisable, the advantage they grant will vanish. You also understand that a curse has been placed on them. 
I also should have said they require attunement, shaping themselves close to the foot of the attuned wearer.

Fucking hell! Well that makes up for spending a week looking for a building üòÇ


DM:
You make quick work of this disassembly job, your mind hyperfocused and rich with years of experience. You cut only the minimum amount of stitches, carefully separating the different part of the boots. Nixt watches closely, visibly impressed. He places his hands on the machine, revealing a series of switches that he starts flicking in a precise order, his brow furrowed. As you feel the magic starting to leave the meterials, the machine whirrs and with that Nat20, you can feel it pulling the arcane energy from what's left on the bench. Soon, you can see a glass jar attached to the cube filling up with a deep purple liquid. Nixt looks excited, slightly bouncing on his short legs


Gigi:
Can Gurt determine what has happened?


DM:
Gotta honour the nat 20, so yes. Aided by your careful dismantlement, the device extracted the magic from the item and condensed it into this strange liquid.

Nixt is elated "Have you ever seen anything like this?! Pure magical energy made physical! And with a cursed item no less! I thought you might get hurt, but you're a genius!"


Gigi:
"Glad I could be of service, but now I'd like an explanation before we continue. Who is this group you speak of? And why go to these lengths?"


DM:
"Please hang on a moment, time for the demonstration" From the shelf, he grabs one of the jars that contains a large toad and sets it on the workbench. He carefully detaches the liquid-filled vial from the device and places it in the toad jar, before sealing it shut. He backs away, grabs a broom and nudges the jar with it from a distance. 
Immediately, a silent explosion happens. The jar trembles on the table, filled with purple vapour. When this dissipates, the sides of the glass are covered with blood and guts, reduced to infinitesimally smalls shreds. No sign of the purple substance.


DM:
He smiles, almost grinning "Do you realise the amount of power that is at our disposal? My group, my employers are perfecting this process. This is just a crude version of their true capabilities. And with your help, we'll make it even more powerful! Think of all the money this could earn you!"


Gigi:
"I'm glad your group is appreciative of my skills, but this seems like a serious decision I'll need some time to think over. When would you need my response by, and how could I contact you to give it?"


DM:
What are your intentions here? Trying to decide if this is Persuasion or Deception


Gigi:
I would like to leave and regroup for the time being


Gigi:
And not have to give and answer yes or no while here


Gigi:
I would say, Persuasion, nothing I said is untrue.


DM:
Yeah, that works for me

Wyveria Request: `[1d20]` Roll: `[17]` Result: `17`


DM:
"Gurt, my employers would really have preferred a commitment now... But I don't think we can afford to lose you over this kind of deadline. I will put my head on the line for this. Tomorrow at noon, meet me at the Library in the Games section if you decide to join us. If not, the higher-ups will be sorely disappointed"


Gigi:
Gurt thanks Nixt.


Gigi:
I assume I can go?


DM:
He will escort you back to the lift through the tunnels, and bring you to ground level. Before saying goodbye, he insists once again that this is the opportunity of a lifetime, and that life can be short. 
You can exit the T√∫ram, disguised or not. It's been about 20 min since everyone evacuated


Gigi:
I will remain disguised until half way back to my inn. I will duck into an alleyway to recast disguise self and appear like a generic tourist, before making my way back to the inn.


Gigi:
I would like to find the others to discuss what has transpired.


DM:
Before you can make it back to the inn, I will ask you for a Deception check, as two mechanics are waiting by the door. "Hey, are you new? Is the fire under control? Where's Mr Nixt?"


Gigi:
Did Nixt not escort me out?


DM:
Oh he brought you to the ground floor, but not out of the tower


DM:
Sorry that wasn't clear


Gigi:
Ok, I'll let the workers know everything seems fine, and Nixt is just inside. My shift was ending as the hubbub was happening and I was just the first person he grabbed to help.

Wyveria Request: `[1d20]` Roll: `[1]` Result: `1`


DM:
Ouch


Gigi:
üòÇ


Gigi:
Haha


Gigi:
Poor guys very confused as to why they think I am lying for no reason


DM:
Haha exactly! They seem very confused, the Clockwork Guild is usually pretty tight on protocol and organisational hierarchy. One of them asks "What's your name? I'll have to report that incident!"


DM:
Just give me a name, they'll push past you to go back into the T√∫ram, and we'll stop there!


DM:
You can reconvene and catch up with the others that evening. Thanks for playing, excited for tomorrow!


Gigi:
Yes, see you tmmr!


DM:
Can you invent a name? Just in case it comes up later


Gigi:
Bonar

DM:
Great!
