## Prep
Session 19 comprises of individual sessions where each member of the party went on an adventure on their own while in Áine. The first part is an asynchronous text session, the second part is through voice chat. To start the session, I sent the below Intro to all players.

### Intro
After your daring prison break, you have decided to stay a week in Áine to follow the terms of your authorisation and avoid raising suspicion. It is as good an opportunity as any to explore the city.

*Description of [[Áine]]*

Lou Beluga is hiding Calico Jack and Esmith in a secret cellar in the Undercity, under the bar of his inn. Called The White Straw Hat, Lou's establishment is located on an artificial beach on the bank of Ben's canal. It can be a place of relaxation or intense partying, depending on the owner's mood. It is the place where you are currently staying. 

The flashy escape of two prisoners has affected the city's atmosphere. You've noticed that guards are on high alert, carrying frequent stops and occasional searches. While not as intolerant of magic as Steorr, the Siblín Guilds treat magic as a potential weapon. Its use is heavily regulated by individual guilds and the Board. Lou therefore warned you to be discreet during your stay.

*What would your character like to do during this week?*

### Arrests
It doesn't take long for the Board's investigators to link the fiery escape of Jack and Esmith to the four missing employees from the kitchen staff.

The investigator are unable to prove these people were directly responsible for the prison break, or trace the bribe back to Sable. 

However, the four are tried for dereliction of duty and aiding in a prison escape. After a hearing in court, they are all receive three-year ban from any of guild membership. In the Siblíns, where guild membership is mandatory, this effectively means they will not be allowed to work legally. They are also each have to pay a fine of 3000 gold pieces or will be imprisoned for 3 years. 

- Alana is a young woman who was hoping to save enough money to open her own restaurant. She has to spend all her savings to pay the fine. She is devastated by the sentence, as she loses her income and her dream.

- Cora is an elderly woman who was working as a baker for the Board. She was a retired member of the Bakers Guild, who sold her own bakery and took the job with the Board to keep herself busy. She agreed to join the scheme because she was bored and curious, and thought it would be a harmless prank. She is shocked and ashamed by the sentence, as she loses her reputation and her friends. She cannot afford to pay the fine, as she lives on a small pension. She faces imprisonment, unless she can find someone to help her.

- Bert is a middle-aged man who was working as a dishwasher for the Board. He was a former member of the Transporters Guild, who lost his job and his ship after a storm. He agreed to take the bribe because he hated his job and wanted to quit. He thought he could use the money to start a new life somewhere else. He is surprised and scared by the sentence, as he loses his chance and his safety. He appeals to his old guild for help, and they agree to pay his fine, on the condition that he works for them again as a sailor or a driver. He has no choice but to accept their offer, even though he dislikes it.
