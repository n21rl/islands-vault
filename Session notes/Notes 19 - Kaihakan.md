Nathan: 
I kind of want to have Kai pick up a tattooing needle and ink and some pigskin and practice tattooing in his downtime basically he's gonna start tattooing his cult members

DM:
As tattooing is more common in sailors, you hang around the harbours in search of the materials you seek. You make it to the Harvest Harbour, where ships are sailing to and from the Siblin island of Cad, and further South towards the Southern Scattered Isles. You notice the harbour is quite busy, as a ship seem to have returned from a whaling expedition.
A crowd of people is gathering around the dock, where a huge whale carcass is being unloaded and cut into pieces. You hear shouts of excitement and admiration, as well as haggling, as the whalers attempt to sell their catch. Give me a perception check to look for a tattoo parlour or a particularly tattooed sailor

Nathan:
Rolled a 16

Nathan:
Ey not bad

DM:
As you scan the harbour, everyone seems to be very involved in managing this bounty from the sea, including a few tattoed people. The most heavily inked person seem to be the captain of the whaling ship. This middle-aged woman is shouting orders to her crew, overseeing the operations. Her skin is weathered by sun and salt, and covered in maritime scenes tattooed in deep blue ink. You also notice a thin elven woman sitting on a rooftop, watching the scene unfolding in the harbour from a distance

Nathan:
I'm going to wait till theres a lull in the activity and approach the captain. "That's a hell of a catch you have there, a bounty to be proud of. The tattoos of your crew are impressive, you've all clearly seen your fair share of the sea. Tell me, if I bought you a drink would you be interested in telling me something of your whaling and of your tattoos?"

DM:
Can I get a Persuasion check with advantage please?

Nathan:
Rolled a 16

DM:
She looks at you and raises an eyebrow. She studies you for a moment and smiles slightly. She seems to be in a good mood, if somewhat weary.
"Well, stranger, you got a keen eye and a smooth tongue, give you that. You're right, this here beast is one of our best prizes yet. Tell you what, let me deal with the rest of this mayhem and join us tonight at The Net Profits tonight"

Nathan:
"That sounds like a plan, I'll see you there!"

DM:
Do you want to skip to that or anything else you want to do before the evening?

Nathan:
I think just skip

DM:
You find the Net Profits pretty easily. It's not too far from the harbour and its sign depicts a fishing net full of gold coins and fish. As you push the door, you are greeted by the smell of ale and fried fish.
It is warm and crowded, as regulars welcome the newly returned whaling crew. You see the captain, sitting alone. A mug in her hand and a smile on her face, she's looking at her crew enjoying the evening

Nathan:
I buy 2 drinks and sit down next to her "Here's that drink I promised. Now tell me, where did you get those impressive tattoos"

DM:
Kai doesn't drink alcohol right? What drinks do you get?

Nathan:
hmm good point. I guess he gets water? Im trying to think of a period appropriate alternative to alcohol lol
some sort of fruit juice maybe?

DM:
Haha well I'll say this place makes a grog where you could substitute rum with malt vinegar... Or an orange juice if you prefer! What do you get for the captain?

Nathan:
orange juice sounds good. I ask the bartender what drink she last got and get another one of those

DM:
The bartender hands you your juice with a mocking "Gotta watch for scurvy, eh?" and a red ale, which you bring to the captain. She downs the rest of her drink quickly and immediately grabs the one you brought her, She raises it and says "The name's Baha. What's yours, stranger?"

Nathan:
"I'm Kaihakan, I'm a trader now but I've seen my share of whaling too. Your crew must be very skilled to take down a beast like that, but I know it takes more than skill to best a whale. I'd say you have some gods blessing. In my tribe, we tattooed our warriors for every hunt they returned from alive. The tattoos tell the story of the hunt and were marks of renown. What stories do your tattoos tell?"

DM: "Well Kaihakan, to new friends, and old stories!" she says before taking a swig and starting to point at each of her tattoes, saying hers also tell stories: one for her first ship, one for her first mate, one for her first love, one for the biggest storm she faced, one for a particularly good catch, the list goes on. She tells you she did most of them herself with squid ink, only getting help for the places that were hard to reach.
"I'll for sure make a new one for this whale, it got us so much coin! These fancy lads will buy even the weirdest bits. We kept some of the meat for tonight though!", she says excitedly

DM: 
She screams "Bring out the meat!" and the room erupt in cheers. Staff bring out plates for the whole crew to enjoy a small part of their catch. Pushing a plate towards you, Baha says "You're a goor listener Kaihakan, want any?" then takes takes a large bite out of her portion and starts chewing. 
She keeps telling you stories, in between bites and swigs of ale, her dwarven constitution seemingly lessening her drunkenness. She tells you of the numerous successful whaling expedition she's been on recently, describing hunting techniques more intense that what the Hakari ever used. 
At one point, she asks you "So are you an experienced tattooist yourself? I could use your help for this whale on the back of my neck". 

DM:
When you refuse the meat, Baha shrugs and says "Suit yourself, more for me!". She finishes both plates, downs another drink, and wipes her mouth with her sleeve. A bit drunk now, she reaches into her bag and pulls out a leather pouch. She opens it and shows you the contents: a few metal needles of different sizes, a small bottle of dark blue ink, a round mirror, pieces of cloth and a vial of clear alcohol for cleaning. 
She says "These are my supplies. I always carry them with me, you never know when inspiration will strike".
She pulls her chair close to you. "Now don't be scared! If your tribe were master tattooists, I'm sure it's in your blood. And I'll guide you through it. Please tell me more about your people as we work, it'll distract me from the pain." 
You catch a glimpse of a few crew members looking at you, some surprised at seeing their captain let a stranger so close, others understanding her obsession with inking.
Please roll a d4 to see how long the process will take. You can tell me what you say about your tribe and give me a Performance check. Then give me a Wisdom or Dexterity or Wisdom check with advantage for the tattoo itself.

Nathan:
Rolled a 3 on the d4

Nathan:
Rolled a 10 on Performance 

Nathan:
Kai mumbles under his breath in response to tattooing being in his tribes blood "Well actually, I'm adopted..."

Nathan:
Rolled a 19 for the tattoo

DM:
She's not very impressed with the way you speak. She keeps talking over you, telling you other stories and giving you instructions about the tattoo. It is a long process, taking about 3 hours, so you get a good amount of practice. Baha tells you are doing very well.
The crew keeps eating, drinking, and celebrating the marvellous catch. As you are about to finish the tattoo, the needle just above Baha's neck, she lets out a sudden skriek of pain and hunches over, holding her stomach. Members of her crew turn towards you both, hands on their weapons

Nathan:
Kaihakan kicks out the chair from behind him in shock, instinctively facing his back to the wall. He holds himself taut and waits for what comes next, ready to summon his Rakau

DM:
Five sailors approach you, slowly and menacingly. They are wielding harpoons and hooks. Abruptly, one of them starts wobbling on his feet. He vomits profusely and falls to the ground. The scene repeats itself around the tavern, with members of the crew falling terribly ill. You hear someone scream "The stranger poisoned the meat!" and Baha turns towards you, her face drenched in sweat "You... FUCKING TRAITOR! I knew something was off when you refused to eat"
Roll for initiative please

Nathan:
Rolled an 11

DM:
Baha is the first to act, despite her altered state. She slashes at you with her large fishmonger knife. 17 and 22 to hit

Nathan:
my ac is 16 without my shield so they both hit

DM:
13 damage and it is your turn

Nathan:
in fact i guess im not wearing armour

DM:
right shit...
What's you AC then?
I'll reduce hers as well, she wasn't expecting a fight

Nathan:
10 + Dex right? so just 10 lol

DM:
ouch
OK your turn
Baha is closest to you, 4 members of her crew are a bit further away. In the chaos, that's apparently the extent of the threat

Nathan:
are there many other people in the bar?

DM:
I rolled for it: about 20 total, 15 being from Baha's crew

Nathan:
shit okay

DM:
So apart from the immediate fight, 10 crew members and 5 other people

Nathan:
And how many are between me and the door?

DM:
So, I rolled a d10 to see how many of the 10Â  other crew members are between you and the door...
I rolled a 10, I'm sorry
They might not all be in fighting shape though
Between the drinking and the illness
You would for sure take opportunity attacks from Baha and one other of the people you're engaged with. Then we can roll for the rest of the bar patrons

Nathan:
hmmmm
I'm going to look to the barkeep and shout "call the guards!! these people have gone mad!" and i'm going to cast misty step and slam right out the door
as I stumble out, I'm going to summon my Rakau
misty step is a bonus and summoning the sword is a full action
I'm going to sort of stumble backwards through the street, facing the bar and waiting for people to come out after me
I'm going to start shouting for the guards

DM:
That's great! Give me a perception check as you find yourself on the street

Nathan:
Rolled a 6 lol

DM:
More guards have been patrolling the streets since the prison break, and it's not long before you hear the clanking of armoured footsteps rushing to the scene. From a distance, you see the door of the Net Profits open and a few people running out, including Baha. As you pass an alley, you feel a hand attempt to grab you from the shadows
You can contest the grapple with Athletics or Acrobatics

Nathan:
Rolled a 9 Athletics

Nathan:
fucks sake

DM:
It's really not Kai's night! You are grabbed by a person cloaked in grey, a strange blade held to your throat. A feminine voice whispers "Not a word..."

Nathan:
fuck
Kai's gonna hold still for a second and ready another cast of misty step onto the rooftops. If knife moves to cut him he's going to use it
"Who are you? What do you want? Im just a practicing tattoo artist please you can take my money!"
"Here, you can even have my sword! It's a family heirloom!"

DM:
The cloaked woman responds "I said quiet! Do you want them to catch you? I don't want your money, just a few answers. Now will you follow me?" Her voice is a bit shaky
You hear shouts and footsteps approaching

Nathan:
"If you wanted me to follow all you had to do was ask!" Kai says in a hissed whisper "Take this knife away from my neck and lead if you're going to lead"

DM:
She hesitates a bit then takes her blade away from your throat. She uses it to point at a sewer plate in the alley. "Here, helps me lift this!"
If you do help her, give me an Athletics check with advantage

Nathan:
Rolled a 26 lol

DM:
Very good! Both of you make quick work of opening the access to the sewers. You see water a few feet below. She says "Quick, jump down"

Nathan:
Kai's going to look back over his shoulder to see what the situation is like on the street and then slip under the sewer hatch
he's going to try to slide down in such away he's facing this woman when he hits the water
and he's going to cast armour of agathys if he has an action left to take

DM:
Give me a Perception check to scope out the situation, an Acrobatics check to do that manoeuvre. And you can cast that spell no problem

Nathan: 
Rolled a 16 perception

Nathan:
Rolled an 8 for acrobatics

DM:
Baha's crew seems to have met up with guards, they're trying to explain the events in between incidences of puking. You just fall face first in the dirty water, but the woman grabs you and pulls you to safety to the narrow ledge. Her hood has fallen and you now recognise her as the elf that was watching the whaling ship from the rooftops

Nathan:
I spit out the dirty water and try to wipe the refuse off my face, taking a step back and still on alert. "Thanks for that, I had less messy escapes in mind but you've caught my interest. What's your business with me?"

DM:
"We can't stay here long, come with me" She makes sure you are following her and she leads you down a labyrinth of tunnels, mostly used to get evacuate waste from the city. A pearl around her neck lights the way. You pass between the bars of a grate, crawl into a pipe, swim underwater, before arriving in a small cave that is mostly flooded but in which the water seems cleaner and less stagnant. She seems to know the place, as some of her gear is here.

Nathan:
Kaihakan stretches and begins to let his guard down somewhat. He has a quick look around the cave at this woman's equipment, looking to see exactly what kind of equipment she has
"So, do I know you from somewhere? If so, sorry but I can't remember your name"

DM:
Give me a Perception check

Nathan:
Rolled a 4

Nathan:
yeeeeesh

DM:
wow
She has some weapons, food and bottles
"I don't believe we've met, no. My name is Aumiha. What is yours? Tell me why a human wears the art of the sea elves on his skin? I imagine some degree of kinship, but why then are you sympathising with the slayers?"

Nathan:
"My name is Kaihakan, and yes I am kin to a slain tribe, raised amongst them. Did you really help me escape just so you could inquire as to my preferred drinking companions?"

DM:
"If you were raised among us, have you abandoned our ways?" You notice she bears tattoos similar in style. She adds, seemingly disappointed: "You must know whales are envoys of Savisi'lo, preservers of the peace of the sea and the underworld beyond. These killers just care to extract meat and coin from whales' bellies. I thought you might be working to undermine them, like me"
