The Bards are a pirate crew that is part of [[Republic]]. Their ship The Banshee is equipped with large pipe through which water and air can move and create sound, making it a sort of giant musical instrument. Their flag depicts a white harp on a black background, looking like a distorted smile. They are known for singing loud and catchy songs during their raids, both to intimidate their opponents and to celebrate their victories. The main song they sing before an assault is [[The Song of the Banshee]].

The Song of the Banshee is an eerie pirate ballad sung by Captain Wayne MacGoshan and his crew The Bards before attacking a target. The lyrics tell of a vengeful banshee that comes for those who hear her mournful singing. When Wayne's magical voice echoes across the water, a ghostly banshee illusion appears, sending chills down enemies' spines. The song weakens their resolve while empowering the pirates for battle.
