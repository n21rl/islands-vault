The Reed Rangers are pirate crew part of the [[Republic]]. They are led by the co-captain triad composed of [[Calico Jack]], [[Anne Bony]], and [[Mary Reed]]. Specializing in wetland environments, the Rangers navigate challenges with agility and stealth. 

Anne joined Jack's crew as he was just starting his pirate endeavours and the two became lovers. Not long after, Mary also joined, bolstering the crew's efficacy with her druidic powers. She soon became involved with Anne as well. 

After Anne's death, Mary and Jack's shared grief eventually turned to romance as they took comfort in each other. They sought out a Mer sorceress to bring Anne back but she returned incomplete, a skeleton woman.  

The deep bond remained however and the three lovers resumed their swashbuckling adventures together. The crew's unique composition reflects the Republic's commitment to inclusivity.
