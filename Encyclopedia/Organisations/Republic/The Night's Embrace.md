The pirate crew is called the Night's Embrace, and they sail on the Moonshadow, a ship that is painted black and has a stealthy design. They are known for their magic, stealth and cunning, such as sneaking into enemy ports, raiding ships at night, and using disguises and deception.

The leader is Captain [[Luna Mahina]], who is based on the moon goddess Selene. She has a silver eye that can see in the dark and a silver pendant that can change its shape. She uses a rapier and a pistol as her weapons.

Other members of the crew are inspired by nocturnal animals: 

- Owl, who is based on the owl god Athena. She is the navigator and strategist of the crew. She uses a telescope and a compass as her tools.
- Bat, who is based on the bat god Camazotz. He is the scout and spy of the crew. He uses a cloak and a mask as his disguise.
- Wolf, who is based on the wolf god Fenrir. He is the fighter and hunter of the crew. He uses a spear and a bow as his weapons.
- Cat, who is based on the cat god Bastet. She is the thief and charmer of the crew. She uses a whip and a dagger as her weapons.
- Fox, who is based on the fox god Inari. He is the trickster and gambler of the crew. He uses a deck of cards and a coin as his props.
