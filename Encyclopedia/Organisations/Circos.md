Circos is an island city-state that is a protectorate of [[Organisations/Selvea/Selvea|Selvea]] 

Among the coral-hued archways of Circos, one finds the heart of sea elven culture beating strongly within the Selvean Empire. These seafaring folks have made the crescent-shaped island their principal home for generations, carrying on the ancient oceanic traditions of their nomadic ancestors.

the isle of Circos stands as the luminous heart of sea elven culture within the Selvean Empire's maritime realms. Here, sweeping archways of pale luminescent stone and winding waterways reflect the celestial cycles that have guided these seafarers through ages of exploration across the Emerald Seas.

**Children of Savisi'lo's Tides**  
Central to sea elven society is the reverence for Savisi'lo, the great whale deity portrayed as the benevolent warden of the ocean's depths. It is by Savisi'lo's grace that the tides ebb and flow, guiding the souls of the dead to their final repose at the sacred coral reef of Pupaia. The arrival of each new moon ushers in the Moontide Rituals, where sea elves make offerings to appease the whale god and ensure bountiful waters.

Whales themselves are regarded as living embodiments of Savisi'lo and treated with utmost reverence. Grave misfortune is said to befall any who dare mistreat these gentle leviathans - their souls cursed to endlessly roam the black depths.

**Masters of the Emerald Tides**  
Beyond their spiritual beliefs, the sea elves of Circos are unmatched masters of all matters relating to the sea. Their maritime prowess and accumulated knowledge of currents, winds, and celestial navigation form the backbone of the Selvean Empire's dominance over the Emerald Seas.

The Moonsinger order of scholars and astrologers use their command over lunar cycles and tidal patterns to ensure safe maritime routes. In the Moonpearl Gardens, exotic aquatic flora is carefully cultivated by the light of the moon's rays.

And within artisan quarters, gifted Tideweavers endlessly spin tapestries depicting the epic voyages and oceanic legends passed down over generations of oral tradition under the moon's watchful gaze.

As eternal as the lunar tides shaping their lives, the sea elves remain steadfast keepers of the emerald waters. Their bond with the cycles of moon and sea has allowed them to thrive as guides, guardians, and heralds of an aquatic realm few surface-dwellers can comprehend.
