Among the elite trade guilds comprising the governance of the Siblín Islands, the Merchants Guild wields immense economic influence as the preeminent authority over import/export commerce and large-scale goods trading. 

## History and Purpose

Originating from collectives of traders and ship merchants in the earliest colonial days, the Merchants Guild consolidated into a chartered fraternity by the 800s S.E. Their mandate was facilitating regulated import/export operations, negotiating trade agreements, and maintaining controlled flows of goods to drive the islands' prosperity.

## Organisation 

The modern guild is headquartered in Áine, with the Primacy of Trade leadership council governing affairs. All trading companies, importers, exporters and large-scale merchants must hold exclusive guild licenses to operate within Siblín territories.

The guild oversees:

**Import/Export**
- Negotiating contracts and trade agreements with other nations
- Inspecting and certifying all incoming/outgoing cargo inventories
- Assessing tariffs and duties on imported/exported goods  

**Mercantile Licensing**
- Issuing rights for companies to import/export specific goods
- Regulating markets, merchant stalls, trade corridors in cities
- Maintaining quality standards for traded products

## Taxation and Fees

The Merchants Guild leverages its control over trade to generate immense revenue streams that help fund the Board of Guilds:

- Exorbitant upfront entry fees for exclusive membership 
- Import/export tariffs and duties on all goods
- Mandatory annual contributions to the Board (higher fees = more council seats)
- Taxes on business transactions and merchant revenues

## Assets and Power

Representing the wealthiest magnates, the guild owns immense vaults of stockpiled goods, commodities and treasures in Áine. This liquid fortune fuels its prosperity and reputation as monopolistic "Lords of Trade."

Critics accuse the increasingly insular guild of being a self-serving oligarchy. However, its lavish profits also fund public works and secure preferential trade policies benefitting all Siblíns.

The Merchants Guild continuously vies to expand its influence within the islands' governance - its economic control translating into political leverage over the Board of Guilds itself.
