The Guildless in the Undercity are a diverse and resilient community comprised of individuals who, for various reasons, are not part of any official guilds in the Siblíns society. This includes people marginalized due to disabilities, criminal records, or societal rejection, as well as those who have fallen from grace or chosen to leave the guild system.

They have a loose organizational structure, not led by a single individual. The Guildless rely on mutual support, sharing resources and skills. Operating outside the guild-regulated economy, they rely on a barter system and an informal economy, providing services and goods unavailable through official channels. The Guildless maintain several safe houses and secret meeting spots in the Undercity, serving as refuges and communal areas for their members. The group represents a wide array of cultural backgrounds, creating a melting pot of traditions and practices within their community. Members of the Guildless face constant struggles, including poverty, danger, and discrimination from the broader society and the guilds. They form an essential part of the Undercity's social fabric, often holding valuable information and serving as a crucial link in the city's informal networks. Without formal representation in government, the Guildless represent the struggles and resilience of those living on the margins of society, highlighting themes of community, survival, and the quest for recognition and rights within a rigidly structured societal system.
