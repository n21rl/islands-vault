The Hakari sea elves were Tanawhu cultists, expelled from their lands by the powerful sea elven tribes and cursed to live out their days on the surface of the Hakari crags, treacherous rocks that found no visitors. They are rocky crags rising out of the ocean made liveable by the stilts, huts, and colourful decoration. From here they would hunt whales to appease Tanawhu and try to eke out an existence.

The Hakari sea elves maintain a strong abhorrence of the magics practised by newcomers to the Islands. They believe these magics will bring about the doom of The Islands. The Hakari do however practice a form of sorcery through a mythical substance they called mana, found in the bellies of whales. They sacrifice the whale mana in rituals to their god Tanawhu, tentacled god of the sunken forests in exchange for its boons and powers. Tanawhu is depicted sometimes as a giant octopus and sometimes as a half octopus half man figure.

If the Hakari sea elves despise the magic practiced by the Steorrians settlers and the Siblín Guilds, but practice their own form of sorcery through the mythical substance called mana, found in the bellies of whales, this could be a source of tension and conflict between the different factions in a D&D campaign. Some possible ways in which this tension and conflict could manifest include:

The Hakari sea elves may view the magic practiced by the Steorrians and the Siblín Guilds as inferior or corrupt, and may be hostile or dismissive towards those who use it. They may see their own sorcery, which is tied to their god Tanawhu and the whales, as superior and more natural.
  
The Steorrians and the Siblín Guilds may view the Hakari sea elves' sorcery as barbaric or primitive, and may be hostile or dismissive towards those who use it. They may see their own magic, which is learned and practiced through academies and guilds, as superior and more advanced.
