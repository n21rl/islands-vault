The Clawed Clans form a loose union of various beast folk clans without a central power, based on the series of volcanic islands known as the [[Dragon's Spine]], which they have occupied for untold generations. Oral histories describe their creation by the cosmic [[Big Beasts]] who emerged from the original chaos.

Early on, the Clans often warred against one another. But faced with encroaching threats from outsiders, they forged a loose confederation for defence. With [[Steorr|Steorrian]] and [[Organisations/Selvea/Selvea|Selvean]] increased interest in conquest, ties strengthened . Despite persisting conflicts, the Clans remain bound by similar language, cosmologies, and traditions. Inter-marriage helps maintain their alliance over generations.

## Culture and religion
Beast folks of the Clawed Clans believe that Big Beasts, powerful animal-like spirits, have created the natural world and all its inhabitants. Each clan traces its ancestry to a different animal, serving as both their patron deity and cultural identity. For example, Bearfolk revere the Slumbering Bear and value patience, while Wolffolk revere Sharptooth ans paint tribal markings in blood. Though identities centre on clans, they see each other as kin united by faith in the Big Beasts. 

Although methods of selecting chiefs vary, they are considered the leaders of their family and clan. Clans most often dwell in communal longhouses decorated with carved totems, wall paintings, and pelts. There are designated spaces for dining, sleeping, crafting, and rituals with intermingled generations. As part of coming-of age-rituals, youths are sent to live in other clans. This often lead to inter-clan marriages, blending families across clan lines and strengthening bonds.

The shamans of each tribe are keepers of lore, medicine, and magic tied to their ancestral beasts. Vision quests in which they channel their patron's spirit are crucial for guidance. Shamans oversee rites of passage, omens, and festivals. Ceremonies involve wearing capes or headdresses adorned with feathers, teeth, fur and other trophies to invoke the Big Beasts' favour and protection. Music and massive bonfires are part of every major ritual.

**Dreadful Dragon**
Dragonborn living on the active volcanoes south of [[Dragon's Spine]] believe that the chain of islands is the body of a gargantuan ancient dragon deity that will one day rise up again, causing fiery destruction and renewal.
When the volcanoes erupt, Dragonborn clans perform ceremonies to celebrate the dragon god becoming active once more. Sacrifices are thrown into the mouths of volcanos and effigies are built from lava rock. Believers hope this will hasten the prophesied return of the Dreadful Dragon.
## Economy
Local fishing, farming and hunting make up the majority of resources for the clans. While raiding passing ships for riches remains a rite of valour for young warriors of some clans, peaceful trade has grown. Some clans maintain trade relationship with other countries.
## The Conclave
Twice a year, on solstices, the chieftains of every clan meet during the Clawed Clan Conclave, hosted by each of the Clans on a rotating basis. They decide on matters that affect all of the Clans, especially on issues of defence against outsiders. While the meeting itself is private, it is accompanied by several days of feasting, during which delegations mingle. Disputes may be settled through contests.

Here are some additional details and expanded elements to further flesh out the Clawed Clans' religion, politics, culture and make them feel like a vibrant, living society:

Religion/Cosmology
- The primordial Big Beasts are vast, near-elemental embodiments of the fundamental forces of nature (earth, sky, sun, moon, storms, etc.)
- They exist in the Incarnadine, a metaphysical realm that intersects with the Prime Material Plane in locations like volcanoes, deep forests, etc.
- Different clans revere different Big Beast Incarnations as their patrons based on geography and natural features of their home islands
- Shamans undergo visionary quests to attain spiritual Ram-Masks that allow them to channel the Incarnations and tap into primordial powers
- Key religious festivals, like the Night of Howling Fire, are timed around astrological and volcanic events of significance
- The Dragonborn volcanic cult actually venerates the Dreadful Dragon as one of the oldest, most powerful Big Beast Incarnations

Politics/Governance  
- While united as the Clawed Clans, each individual clan is sovereign and self-governing under their respective chieftains
- Clan lineages and kinship ties are crucial - newborn children are symbolically offered clan status based on their blood relations
- A council of clan elders advises each chieftain, with specific roles like loremaster, warchief, ceremoniarch, etc.
- Induction trials like dream-quests, trials of endurance, or ritual scarification are required before joining a clan council
- At the Conclave, established customs like the Smokefire Debates allow clans to ceremonially air grievances before arbitration
- Intermarriage is encouraged to maintain stability - children of mixed clans can choose their clan identity during Rites of Distinction  

Culture/Society
- Most clans are semi-nomadic, following set migration paths based on seasons and availability of resources
- Temporary clan campsites like the mammoth-bone Kalnakai are dismantled and reassembled each migration cycle  
- Vibrant traditions of body art (species-specific), maskmaking, woodcarving, and tapestry weaving exist
- Totemic dances, spirit-haunted music from bone flutes/drums, and mythic storytelling are key art forms
- Clan warriors focus on specific tactical spheres - Wolfclan are stealthy huntsmen, Bearclan are furious berserkers, etc.
- Ritual shamanic duels, sacred games of strategy, and celestial games are deeply embedded in their culture
- A complex code of ecological ethics and respect for nature's order governs the clans' philosophy

By delving into these types of granular details, you can really bring the vibrancy and depth of the Clawed Clans' society to life. It makes them a fully realized culture existing in the larger world, rather than just a background element.
