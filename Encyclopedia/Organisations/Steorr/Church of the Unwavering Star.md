organisation directing the worphsip of the [[Unwavering Star]] 

Their religious symbol is an eight-pointed star. The church of the Unwavering Star is an important faction within the Kingdom and the religion is used as a motivation to expand.

The state religion of [[Steorr|Steorr]] and its colony is the worship of the Unwavering Star, a dark celestial body . 
The Church of the Unwavering Star is an influential institution within the Kingdom. [[Steorr|Steorr]] wants to extend its colonies and enforce worship of the Star.

The Star shines above the city of Star Point. By following it in the sky, explorers from the [[Steorr]] discovered the Islands. The discovery of this land of plenty was seen as proof that the Star was on [[Steorr|Steorr]]'s side

The Kingdom of Steorr is looking to convert the indigenous people of the archipelago to their religion or ideology. The colony could be used as a base for missionaries, who would seek to spread the kingdom's beliefs and practices among the native inhabitants.
