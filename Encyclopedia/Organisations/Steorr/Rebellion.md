## Overview
Some nobles based in the Steorrian cities of [[Star Point]] and [[Sealtham]] have a secret plot to rebel against the [[Steorr|Crown]]. Those include the mayors of both cities, [[Lady Mayor Theis]] and [[Lord Mayor Brummb√§r]] respectively. Unsatisfied whit the lack of say in the Steorrian politics and lack of support from the kingdom despite their major economic contribution, they are planning for their provinces to become independent from Steorr, and even possibly wrest control of the whole Colony from the Kingdom. They have an intricate [[Rebellion plot|plot]] to gain military advantage.
