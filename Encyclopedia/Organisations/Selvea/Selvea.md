Selvea is a elven empire that originated in the Islands. Its cities were built on tall mesas on an island in the south of the archipelago. Its capital is [[Selvea (city)|Selvea (city)]] and other cities include Torroccia, Fiumille, and Meridion. Selvea has extended its sphere of influence, often clashing with [[Steorr]]. An uneasy peace was reached after Steorr failed to take back the province of Harbourjaw Selvea had annexed.

 
Selvea view the Islands as their ancestral right, they have a deep connection to the land and sea surrounding it. They are syncretic and pluralist, integrating other beliefs into their own.

Their capital is made of pyramids built in the jungle, carved from the stone of the mesas. A network of rivers is used for transportation across the island of Selvea, with nimble long boats similar to canoes. Larger versions, fast and manoeuvrable, go out at sea. 

Selvea resents the Kingdom of Steorr for their attempts to colonize the archipelago and impose their culture and beliefs on the native inhabitants, seeing the kingdom as a threat to their way of life.



**Selvea** refers to both the elven capital and empire situated within the southern jungles of Domiselvea.

## History
Rather than relying solely on military conquest, they expanded their influence through trade and 
Many islands became protectorates, retaining local governance while adopting Selvean language, arts, architecture, and magic traditions. Intermarriage incorporated noble families into the elven bloodlines. Puppet rulers allowed indirect rule.

Wars flared when islands resisted absorption into the Selvean sphere. But the empire prefers subtly exerting economic and cultural dominance over naked military force.

## Culture
Selvean culture values refinement, scholarly knowledge, and mastery over both nature and arcane secrets. Practitioners devote decades to perfecting spellwork and art forms. Cuisine utilizes exotic jungle fare and botanical alchemy.

## Government
Selvea has a ruling family, among which the Speaker and the Keeper are chosen and form a duumvirate. The Speaker is mostly in charge of foreign policy, while the Keeper takes care of domestic policy. They both hold religious power. Only members of the ruling family and the people they chose practise magic, it is seen as a boon from the gods. 

The imperial family rules from a lavish tiered palace complex situated atop monumental stepped pyramids within the capital. Members of client noble families fill advisory and administrative roles.

Policies promote the spread language, customs, architecture, and beliefs 
Loyalty is maintained through a mix of sanctions, patronage, and soft power rather than brute force.

Among the elven architects and artists who designed Selvea's iconic grand pyramids, there is a persistent myth that the structures were not merely built - but grown. It claims that through still-secret techniques merging magic, music and agricultural art, the pyramids sprouted from germinated monolithic seeds over generations.
This process allowed the pyramids' growth to be carefully cultivated and controlled to achieve their incredibly precise dimensions and alignment to celestial forces. As they grew, the living pyramids were suffused with metaphysical energy and subtle enchantments through measured applications of spellsong and powerful artifacts.
Once reaching their maturity, the pyramids' growth was arrested to fix their forms, now only requiring maintenance. Some believe the pyramids still hold a dormant sentience or cosmic connection, awaiting the right sublime catalyst to rouse their


Religion and Human Sacrifice
Drawing from Maya, Aztec and other Mesoamerican beliefs, Selvea's state religion could revolve around a complex pantheon of nature deities represented through elaborate rituals, ceremonies and even human sacrifice to ensure agricultural fertility, avert disasters and uphold the cosmic order. 

Conquering enemies and ceremonially offering high-status captives to the gods could be a major driver of Selvea's imperialistic ambitions and a core part of its warrior culture.

Calendar Systems  
Like their real-world counterparts, Selvea's priestly caste could utilize advanced astronomical observations and intricate calendar systems. Perhaps they experience apocalyptic events when cosmic cycles realign on dates calculated with great precision.


Social Structure Divergences
- Rather than a strict hereditary nobility, Selvea's upper castes could be more merit-based, with admittance regulated through ritualistic tests of skill, intelligence and fortitude overseen by priestly orders.
- Instead of typical Euro feudal landed lords, have a more centralized system where high-ranking castes are essentially drawn from monastic/scholar-warrior orders dedicated to upholding Selvean philosophy and values.
- De-emphasize the feudal aspect by making Selvea's territories more akin to a decentralized, ritualized tributary system between semi-autonomous city-states.

Religious Distinctions
- Polytheistic nature worship over typical Western monotheistic analogues. The gods are elemental forces to be kept in balance, not moral arbiters.
- Reframe human sacrifice as a consensual, honored obligation rather than an enforced subjugation. Voluntary "star-cults" who ritualistically offer themselves.
- Seamless integration of religion into every aspect of life, knowledge, and civic ceremony rather than an established dogmatic church structure.

Architectural Divergences  
- Rather than traditional medieval castle/keep design, double down on Mesoamerican-inspired towering pyramids and carved stone cities integrated with the environment.
- Incorporate cosmic alignments and advanced astronomy into the orientation and layout of major ceremonial structures and observatories.
- Use of living building materials like sculpted trees/vines and waterworks alongside stonework in creative ways.

By leaning further into cultural distinctions inspired by Mesoamerican sources that diverge from typical Western fantasy norms, Selvea's society can feel truly unique while still resonating with an authentically developed alternate history. Let me know if you would like me to expand on any of these concepts further!

Cities constructed in line with Mesoamerican urban planning -
buildings centered on plazas for rituals, surrounded by pyramids and temples, with residential clusters nearby
•Pyramids have intricate carved relief Sculptures depicting apocalyptic events, deities, cosmological symbols
Calendars use a 52-year cycle "bundle" akin to the Mesoamerican ritual calendar round, with years represented as Glyphs
Priests perform astronomical observations and numerological divinations to reaffirm cosmic order is maintained
Blood rituals sacrifice humans (prisoners, slaves, debtors) by removing still-beating hearts with obsidian blades
Art/iconography rich with depictions of serpents, jaguars, eagles devouring human hearts Some commoners file their teeth into jagged shards as a mark of piety

and monumental architecture to their religious practices of human sacrifice and following convoluted calendars/celestial prophecies. •Have a strict, multi-tiered caste/ class system that governs all aspects of Selvean society, potentialy with lineage and bloodlines being extremely important. Blend this with an imperialistic drive to continually expand their cultural influence through subjugation of outside peoples.
Develop unique Selvean artistic and scientific endeavors like hieroglyphic writing systems, sophisticated metallurgy, advanced mathematics/ astronomy, and masterful masonry that flaunts their sophistication compared to lesser "barbarian" cultures.
Give Selvean magic/religion an obsession with concepts of duality, balance, cyclical rebirth and death they could worship co-existing but opposing deities or be trying to uphold cosmic order.

The elven city of Selvea could be built around the concept of cosmic alignments, with pyramids and temples oriented to specific stars or constellations believed to be the manifestations of their deities.
Introduce a ritualistic "bloodletting" practice among Selvea's elite, where they sacrifice a small amount of their own blood to appease the gods and ensure cosmic balance. This could be a highly revered and sacred tradition.
Develop a complex system of numerology and calendars based on the cycles of nature, which the elves use to predict astrological events, plan religious festivals, and determine auspicious dates for important events.
