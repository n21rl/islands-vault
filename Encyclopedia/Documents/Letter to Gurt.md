Dear Gurt, 

Your remarkable technological talents have not gone unnoticed among certain circles here in Áine. Rather than joining a Guild with all the restrictions it entails, we have a unique position to present to you. 

It aligns perfectly with your abilities and would not only be highly profitable, but also allow you to explore mysteries at the frontiers of the physical and arcane worlds. We propose a meeting to discuss this further.

We have arranged for you to join a tour of the Túram at midday tomorrow; your name is already on the list of authorized visitors. Should you chose to accept this meeting, please wear the enclosed item and our representative will approach you during the tour. Discretion is paramount, so please come unaccompanied. Should you refuse, please keep the item as a token of our admiration and forget you ever received this letter.

We hope you will consider this opportunity, it is a chance for you to be part of something much larger and more significant than you could ever dream of.

Sincerely,
Your friends in the Siblíns
