## Preamble
In the spirit of freedom, cooperation, and the pursuit of fortune, we Captains hereby establish this Code to govern our Republic on behalf of all free Mates. 
## Article I
All Mates of the Republic shall stand as equals, free to live and act as they choose, regardless of race, gender, or background.
## Article II
Mates may freely assemble into Crews, exercising their right to choose their companions. At any time outside of action, a Crew may elect or remove its Captain by majority, with every Mate holding an equal vote. Captains shall lead their Crew in any way they see fit, provided it is in accordance with this Code. 
## Article III
To address matters of importance to the entire Republic, Captains shall form a Council. During Council decisions, Captains shall hold a number of votes proportional to the size of their Crew, preserving the voice of all Mates. 
## Article IV 
In most matters requiring resolution, the Republic shall adhere to the principle of majority decision-making. However, no group, however large shall infringe upon the inherent rights of any individual Mate or compromise the principles set forth in this Code.
## Article V
All have a right to benefit from their labour. Gains acquired through shared ventures shall be fairly divided. Captains shall take care to reward both rank and merit when allocating shares. 
## Article VI
The Republic shall be a sanctuary for all Mates. Parley should be preferred over violence, but grave offences against the Republic or its Mates shall be met with swift and fair justice, regardless of rank or status. Punishment shall be proportionate to the severity of the transgression. 
## Article VII
In order to safeguard individual and collective freedom, all Mates shall endeavour to protect the Republic against threats from within and without. Crews shall provide each other aid in times of need and collaborate on projects, fostering a sense of solidarity and ensuring the resilience and strength of the Republic. 
## Article VIII
While force may be required in service of the Republic's safety, prosperity, and other interests, Mates should avoid causing undue harm to non-combatants. Surrendering foes shall be treated fairly and may be offered the opportunity to join a Crew.
## Article IX
This Code, as a living living covenant, acknowledges the evolving nature of our Republic. It may be amended, subject to a two-thirds majority vote of the Council.
## Conclusion
May this Code be our guiding light in the stormy seas. May it bind us together in the threads of unity. May it act not as chains but as a shield to preserve our freedom. 
We, all our Mates, and those who come after, will follow and defend our Code. So swear we, the founding Captains of the Republic.
