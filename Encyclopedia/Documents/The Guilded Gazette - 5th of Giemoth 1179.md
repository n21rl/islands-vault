## Report Blames Pirate Calico Jack for Deadly Ship Destruction
The investigation into the tragic sinking of the fluyt Fortune's Favour last Haustoh has reached its conclusion at last. Officer Galen, Board official overseeing the inquiry, announced that "recent breakthroughs" allowed investigators to conclusively implicate the notorious Catfolk pirate known as Calico Jack in this heinous act. The transport ship, part of the Flying Fleet (Transporters Guild), had been hired by a Steorrian merchant to carry goods from Wesson Wines (Winemakers Guild) to the city of Sealtham. 

The report contends that Calico Jack snuck aboard the ship one day before it departed Áine on the 4th of Gieman. One day later, the cruel pirate detonated strong explosives in the hold. The fluyt was completely obliterated in the ensuing violent blast, resulting in the death of 26 of the passengers and crew members, as well as the loss of an estimated 8000 gold worth of cargo. 

The notorious marauder has been held in the island-prison of Cavea since his arrest, when he was found unconscious floating near the wreckage. Already facing piracy charges, he is expected to face trial before the end of the month. This wanton act of terror all but guarantees he will be sentenced to death.

## Building Guild Tensions: Disagreements over Guild Fees and New Guild Creation 
The Builders Guild is facing internal strife as a large number of journeypersons and apprentices, protest against the recent hike in guild fees. These lower-ranking members argue that the fee increase is unjustified, especially given their lack of effective power within the Guild's decision-making processes. However, Grandmason Gladstone and most masters maintain that higher fees are necessary for the Guild's smooth operation and to retain its political influence on the Board. Negotiations are ongoing, with the hope to satisfy all parties. 

Meanwhile, a group is taking steps to establish a new Maintenance Guild, aiming to represent a broad spectrum of workers, including cleaners, housekeepers, launderers, gardeners, and handypeople. By forming their own guild, they hope to gain a unified voice and regulate their trade. However, other guilds stand to loose. Indeed, this move would eat away at their membership as these maintenance workers are typically members of their employer's guild. 

## Cad Orchards Face Worst Harvest in the a Decade
A protracted heatwave has devastated the island's crops last season, threatening livelihoods. Farmers hope emergency aid from the Board or the Fields Guild will help offset worst yields in ten years.

## Reward for Monstrous Avian Capture
Several sightings of a gargantuan bird of prey were reported on the night between last Sordag and Sorvest. Witnesses described it as "larger than a Steorrian warship". 

Experts at the Menagerie in Áine believe the beast was a roc, a species rarely seen outside of remote mountainous regions. A 5000 gold reward has been offered for the live capture of the colossal bird. The Board however warned that rocs are extremely dangerous and advised citizen to report sightings to the nearest authorities.

## Volcanic Eruption Shakes the Dragon's Spine
The fiery peak on Drakonis erupted without warning for the third time in five years. Lava flows destroyed two dragonborn villages but many locals see the eruption as heralding the awakening of their god.

## Perfume Production Halted Amidst Rash Outbreak
Several perfume shops in the Uppercity were temporarily closed after customers complained of severe skin rashes.  Authorities suspect that a batch of whale ambergris used in fragrance manufacturing may have been tainted. All sale of ambergis and perfume will cease until the exact source of the skin irritation is identified.

This is another blow the the whaling industry, only days after entire crews fell violently ill after consuming whale meat, with one sailor succumbing to dehydration. The cause of the ailment is unclear, although excessive drinking might have played a role. 

## Opera House Construction Delayed Amidst Archaeological Discovery
The long-awaited project to replace the aging Performance Hall on Ben broke ground last week. The Entertainers Guild had promised a grand opening by 1183. However, further works will be delayed until a full archaeological survey is completed as ancient golden artefacts were found during foundation works. These items could shed a new light on our islands' distant pas

## Solar Eclipse to Darken Skies Early Next Year
An uncommon and brief eclipsing of the sun is expected on the third week of Veran 1180. The Sages Guild plans public lectures on eclipse lore and science, as well as a private viewing event at the Observatory.

## Minor Fire Disrupts Tour at the Túram
A small fire broke out yesterday inside the renowned Túram, disrupting an exclusive guided tour and causing the clock tower to be evacuated. "We were just examining the core mechanisms when one of the attendants suddenly shouted about a fire," recalled Seraphina Goldleaf, the tour guide leading the group. "Smoke began billowing and he ordered us all to evacuate immediately. A foreign visitor could not be located but I was told he found another exit".

This was confirmed by a representative from the Clockwork Guild. It appears the incident was swiftly contained with no reported injuries or lasting damage to the tower or any of its marvellous engineering.

## Heightened Security Measures Across the Siblíns
Residents of all the Siblín islands have noticed a significant increase in security measures over the past few days. Additional guard units have been visibly patrolling the streets and conducting searches at all times of the day. At harbours, inspections procedures appear to have been tightened as well. 

The Board of the Guilds has not issued any official statements so far. "We cannot discuss any specific operations," stated an unnamed security officer when asked for comment. "But citizens should know we are acting to safeguard the well-being of the Guilds". Speculation has been rampant about the cause for such increased vigilance. Some suggest it may be a pre-emptive measure in response to rising piracy in neighbouring waters. More recently the theory of an incident at Cavea has emerged. Indeed, four cooks hired to work on the island-prison have been arrested on undisclosed charges yesterday. 

For the time being, inhabitants have been advised to comply with the additional screening measures and report any suspicious activities to the proper authorities. The Board has promised more information once the situation allows.
