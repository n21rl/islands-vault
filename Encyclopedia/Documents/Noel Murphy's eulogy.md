- We are pirates. So no lies between us. He wasn't the greatest fighter, and he wasn't the worst. He had some good raids and he dogged a few bad ones. But the motherfucker had his moments. Yes, he fucking did. You remember the jail break? The boarding of the Fussock? 

- Right. 

- He brought that loot home. And that time he took down five soldiers, drunk and nearly naked, that was Noel Dropkick Murphy at his best. And Librisola a few years back, the dream leaf fire. He kicked a lot of asses... Yes, indeed. He won as much as he lost.  Much as any of us. *(nearly crying)*

- Oh, for the Star's sake, Wayne play the fucking song, already. 

- Did he piss off a guy or twelve? No fucking doubt. I think the worst one was his brother, but they always made up, thank the gods. Did he say the wrong shit now and then? Did he bust balls and get pissed and forget to write to his mother and fuck the wrong broad for the wrong fucking reason every now and then? Who fucking doesn't, Gods?! Was he as full of shit as every other sad-sack motherfucker in this Republic? Abso-fucking-lutely. His shit was as weak as ours, no question. But Noel stood with us... all of us, here, fighting, sharing a little corner of this freedom experiment. He was called. He sailed. He rests. To Noel Murphy!
