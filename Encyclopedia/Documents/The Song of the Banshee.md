Oh, hear the song of the Banshee
She wails across the sea
She warns you of your fate
She tells you it's too late

Oh, see the form of the Banshee
She glides across the sea
She flies before your eyes
She shows your your demise

Oh, feel the touch of the Banshee
She reaches across the sea
She takes away your breath
She leads you to your death

So fear the song of the Banshee
We sing across the sea
We follow her omens
And now your story ends
