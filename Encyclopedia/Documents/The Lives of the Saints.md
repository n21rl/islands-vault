*Compiled by Cryridithite Sisters of Parchminster*

In the earliest days of the Faith, there were those who walked in the Star’s light more closely than anyone. 

Their deeds shaped the path 
and laid the foundations of the world as it is known today. 

Their works, though beyond the reach of ordinary people, were never born of sorcery. 12qa Star granted strength to the faithful ut through clarity of purpose, discipline, and devotion.
Chosen by the divine will that guided their steps, they stood as examples of righteousness, wisdom, and duty. 

Their miracles were the works of the righteous proof that faith alone is sufficient to change the world.

The Saints walked before us, shaping the world through faith, toil, and duty. Although 

Their age has passed, yet their light remains.

Inspiration to us 



## Saint Astron, the Unifier

**Patron of Kings, Law, and Divine Order**

Astron was born the night the Star first appeared, and it is said that from his first breath, he was marked for greatness. 

.

## Saint Weland, the Hand That Forges 

**Patron of Laborers, Craftsmen, and the Sanctity of Work**  

_"A blade must be tempered before it is strong. The same is true of people."_

Weland was a talented smith who forged the best weapons the world had ever seen. He took a shard of the Star that had fallen from the heavens and shaped it into Hardblade, the Sword of Kings, first wielded by Astron. 

Captured, he was forced to work in the forge of an tyrant. Rather than forging weapons for a ruler he did not believe in, he stepped into the flames of the forge. The smithy erupted and when the smoke cleared, he was gone.
His anvil remains, unscathed by fire or time.

## Saint Brenna, the Wind 

**Patron of Sailors, Exploration, and Trust in the Unknown**  

_"The waves are not against you. They simply do not care whether you drown."_

Brenna did not fear the sea. She set sail **in search of the land where the Star first touched the world.** She and her fleet vanished into the **Black Horizon**, a stretch of ocean that had swallowed many before her.

For **three years**, the faithful watched the tides, waiting. Then, on the morning of the third year, **a single ship returned.** Its sails were whole, its hull unbroken, but **there was no crew.** In the captain’s log, only a final entry:

_"The Star is brighter here. I am going forward."_

Her route has never been found. Some say she reached the land she sought. Others believe she **still sails, beyond the edge of the map, waiting for those who can follow her course.**



## Saint Rochel, the Healer
**Patron of Healers, Midwives, and Those Who Ease Suffering**  

_"Pain is not an enemy. It is a burden we must carry for those who cannot."_

Rochel bore a wound that never closed, yet **it did not fester, nor did it weaken her.** Some say it was **placed upon her by the Star**, so she would always share in the suffering of the world.

Hallow, a great hound never left her side. During the **Siege xx, she worked for three days without vcaa, tending to the wounded, her hands steady even when her own body faltered.

When she died, **Hallow lay upon her grave and did not rise.,


## Saint Saulina, the Preacher
**Patron of Missionaries, Speech, and the Spreading of Faith**

_"A truth unspoken is no truth at all."_

Saulia was once an enemy of the faith. She rode against the faithful, **tearing down their shrines and silencing their voices.** But the Star had marked her, and when it came for her, **it burned her sight away.** 
For three days, she wandered blind. When her vision returned, she saw **only the Star, its light in all things.** She became its voice, spreading its truth to every corner of the land. At the trial of Roemeg, she was condemned to fire. But as the flames rose, **she sang instead of screaming.** Some say her voice still carries on the wind.

## Saint Dorian, the Pillar of Purity
**Patron of Ascetics, Discipline, and the Cleansing of the Soul**  

_"The body is weak. The soul is unyielding. Which one do you choose to serve?"_


Dorian placed an **iron circlet upon his brow**, a weight to remind him that **the Star watches always.**

Never visibly aged. 


## Saint Heorstan, the Bastion of Faith
**Patron of Warriors, Guardians, Duty**

_"A battle is not won by those who strike first, but by those who refuse to fall."_

When the enemy reached the **Bridge at Ironridge**, Heorstan stood alone. As his people destroyed the bridge behind him, **he held the passage, unmoving.**

When his blade broke, he fought with his fists. **When they finally cut him down, they found him still standing, propped against the ruins.**


## Saint Cyridith, the Scribe
**Patron of Knowledge, Law, and the Foundations of Civilization**  

_"The Star’s light is not given—it must be sought, shaped, and shared."_

Cyridith created the Steorrian script, facilitating ensuring the faith would never be lost. 

When rulers sought to corrupt her writings, she burned her own hands so no falsehood would bear her mark.
