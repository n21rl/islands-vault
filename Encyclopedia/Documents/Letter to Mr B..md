Mr B. 

As we discussed, you will deliver the cargo to your friends then return to your usual business while they work on their craft. However, I must add another request. 

I understand the full process will take time, but I insist you bring a sample of the work back before the end of next month. Then, we will commit to further deliveries and payments. 

You have my continued support and protection, as long as you keep serving your purpose. Remember you are not the only one who can do this job. Fulfil your mission and you will have a part to play in the glorious future of our Islands. 

F.
