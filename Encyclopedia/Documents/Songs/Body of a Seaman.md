The brigantine stood by the shore and Steorrians were within
And the smuggler boys they hissed advice 'firebomb her with some gin'
Well we turned and shook as we had a look in the room where the dead man lay
So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip to the land where his fathers lay

And fifteen minutes later we had our first taste of whiskey
There was uncles giving lectures on ancient island history
The men all started telling jokes and the women they got frisky
At five o'clock in the evening every bastard there was piskey

Fare thee well gone away there's nothing left to say
Farewell to Sealtham Harbor boys to Star Point and its bay 
He took them out with a well-aimed clout and they often heard him say 
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue say

He fought the scout in Freeport and he slashed him to the ground 
He took on Tiny Tartanella and it only went one round
He never had no time for kings, for drink or dice or whores
But he never fled a fight when a fight was right, so they sent him to the war

Fare thee well gone away there's nothing left to say 
With a cheers Joe and yo ho ho, my love's in New Destinay
The calling of the great wide sea, Siblín wine from far away 
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue sea 

This morning on the harbour when I said goodbye to you 
I remembered how I swore that I'd come back to you one day 
And as the sunset came to meet the evening on the hill
I told you I'd always love you, I always did, I always will 

Fare thee well, gone away, there's nothing left to say  
But say adieu to your eyes as blue as the water in the bay  
To big Jim Dwyer, the man of wire, who was often heard to say
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue say

I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue say
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue say
