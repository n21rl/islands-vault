campaign: "[[A Province on the Edge]]"

*"For those who have travelled here from distant lands, for those who stand beneath these stars for the first time—know that the Festival of Balance is among the oldest of our traditions. Every twelve years, when we realign our sacred calendars to the heaven's cycles, we mark the moment by bringing ourselves into balance as well. The tides shift, the rivers carve new paths, the earth turns, and so too must we follow natural rhythms we give thanks to the forces that sustain us, and we stand together to affirm that we are not separate, but part of a greater whole.

Each of us—by our blood, our spirit, our toil—plays a role in maintaining that balance. And so, before we set forth into the next cycle, let us give thanks to those who have upheld it. To **Tzecto** and those who safeguarded this gathering, ensuring that all could celebrate without fear. To the **workers**, who built the structures that housed us, who prepared the spaces for our rituals. To the **healers**, whose steady hands mended the wounded. To the **crafters**, whose skill adorned this city with beauty, whose tools provided what was needed. To the **dancers and musicians**, who filled our streets with joy. And to all who came—whether to test their strength, to honor tradition, or simply to witness—this festival was yours as much as it was ours."*

_(Paxitli pauses briefly, their gaze sweeping over the crowd, acknowledging both triumph and tension.)_

*"Not every moment was without conflict, nor should it be. Balance is not the stillness of stone but the meeting of forces. Through challenge, we are tested. Through discord, we are reminded of what must be held firm. And yet, we stand here at the festival’s end not as those divided, but as those who have endured together. We have done as we have always done. The balance has been restored.

And now, the Festival is ended.

Let this moment be marked. As the **Eye of the Gloam** lights the sky, let us clap once—one sound, as one people. Then, in silence, let us stand beneath the stars and know that the cycle has begun anew."*

_(A single **resounding clap** echoes through the plaza, then **hush falls** as all eyes turn upward. The night deepens. The cycle turns. Balance is set.)_
