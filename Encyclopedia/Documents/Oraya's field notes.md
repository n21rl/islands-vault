campaign: "[[A Province on the Edge]]"
---
## Arrival 
I have finally made it. The stories, songs and artefacts I collected over the years were not enough. I needed to come to the cradle of the Tetzilwahi elves to learn more about the story of my people, of the grandmother who I was named after. 

## The Mounds
The overgrown mounds still tower above the canopy. Time has not been kind to the masks; most are now reclaimed by a century of plant growth and erosion. They still look majestic despite this, more impressive than I could have ever imagined. The place is oddly serene under their gaze. I am not alone however. I hear whispers and footsteps. 

## The Takers
The Takers are desecrators. But just like my people who were raiders in their time, they are also survivors. Yes, they steal and pillage, but somehow I cannot fully blame them for doing what they must to keep on living. There are still valuable materials here, and the mounds offer a valuable hideout in this jungle. 

Most of the Takers are outcasts, and I am glad the mounds could offer them some semblance of safety, when it wasn't enough for the Tetzilwahi. 

## The Maskbearers
The Maskbearers say they are followers of the Way of the Masked God. They have a beautiful reverence for the mounds and the gods. I sang them a vinesong my grandmother once taught me. One of the goblins cried. 

Alas, they are also misguided. The masks were never meant for people, or to be used as a source of individual power. But they only seem to listen to Hybris. Still, I understand they are also looking for answers, even if their way is different to mine. 

## The Frog
The frog stared at me with its wide red eyes and I forgot what I was doing. 
They call it the Dream Eater. They believe it consumes dreams and memories during sleep. People keep small bowls of salt nearby when they sleep to ward it off but I don't know if it works. 

## Dreams
Same dream again. The old male drow  in rags, skin like bark. He does not speak. He only smiles a toothless grin and stares under heavy eyelids, barely open. Is this the presence they call the Drowsy One? 

## Time 
The groups are growing. Each passing year, new lost souls join them and new innocent souls are born. Maskbearers and Takers often have skirmishes, over territory, artefacts and petty squabbles. I wish the pointless battling would stop. 
But I am just an old woman woman now and very few listen to my advice. I spend less time with them, and more on my own. And with the spirits. 

## The Hollow
I went down in the deepest root paths, the hollow that seems to connect all parts of this place. He was waiting. The one from the dreams.

## Name
I think I've forgotten my name. They call me Yaya now but it doesn't sound right.

## The Vine-Taken
They do not speak in ways we understand. Met a girl near the threshold with roots for fingers. She did not speak but looked at me intensely. 

## My Voice
 I tried to sing today. The vinesong. But my voice caught. Not on memory, but on moss. It slid from my throat in a ribbon. When I unwrapped it, I saw words
I burned the moss. 


## The Boy Who Painted His Eyes

He said the gods would not see him if he closed his eyes too tightly, so he painted new ones on his lids. When he slept, they stared outward.

He was the first to tell me the old man was not a priest, but a door. He whispered it like a curse, as if saying it aloud might open it.

I think he was right.

## The First Mask Duel
They called it a rite, but it was a fight to the death. Two men—one with a fanged mask, one painted blue like sap.

The crowd called for blood before the masks ever touched.

When I asked what the duel was for, the winner said: ‘So the mask remembers.’

It doesn’t. Only I do.


## Sikki the Half-Orc Trader
Sikki gave me half a stewed root and a grin full of metal. She said, ‘We don’t pray here. We pay.’

I showed her a carved name-chant. She laughed. Called it ‘curse-speak.’

Three nights later, she vanished near the pool where the vines bloom red. The Takers blamed the ‘mask ghosts.’ I know better.



## 
Haon was once an herbalist. He said he joined the seekers to find a cure for grief. He carried a pouch of moss and a quiet hatred of the Steorrians.
He fasted beside the mask one night. In the morning, he no longer spoke in first person.  
‘The roots say... the dream says…’
Now they call him High Priest.

## The First Offering Bowl
It was not Tetzilwahi. Too shallow. Too polished. Selvean design. Blood grooves carved in imitation of jungle veins.
The Maskbearers placed it beneath a hanging mask. When I told them it was foreign, they told me the gods do not care where the bowl comes from, only that it fills.
I hope they’re wrong.


## The Bones in the Crawlspace
Child-sized. Curled in prayer position. Mask split down the middle. Fungus had grown from the eyes.
Someone buried them with flowers. That’s the part that broke me. The care.

## First Vine-Taken Encounter
I thought it was a woman, until she stood.
The vines grew from her ribcage like limbs. Her hair was moss. She walked like she’d forgotten knees.
She looked at me—not with recognition, but with… possibility. I felt my own shape bend slightly.
I think she had my laugh. Once.

## On the Jungle Listening
The mounds do not speak. But they listen. I know because they’ve stopped when I stop.
Sometimes I feel them tilting toward me, like a parent trying to catch a whisper.
They have not spoken since the fall. Maybe they’re waiting for me to finish the sentence.



## The Mask Grove Awakens
They said the masks bled. I thought it was sap.
But then I touched one. It whispered my mother’s name—one I never wrote down.
I asked it who carved it. It said: ‘You did.’

## A Forgotten Song
Three verses of a lullaby. The same one I found in three different mouths, two in the jungle, one in a dream.
They do not remember who taught it to them. But each sings it with the same wrong note in the fifth line.
I think the Hollow is singing through them.

## The Dreamer Who Hums
There is an old man in the Grand Mound. I do not know his name. He speaks in murmurs and hums, like water trapped in wood.
The others—scavengers, zealots, drifters—call him ‘the Drowsy One.’ Some fear him. Some leave him gifts. One child tried to sleep near him and woke without her own name.”*
I sat near him for three days. He never blinked. Once he reached for my hand and vines curled beneath my skin. They left no mark—but I remembered a song I had never learned.
I think he is dying. But I think something else is not.”*

## The Carvers in the Hollow
_Location_: Slid into a mask’s mouth in the Hollow Paths  

_Time_: Shortly after her first contact with proto-Maskbearers

They carve faces with reverence and error. The wood is not sacred, but they treat it so. They call themselves ‘followers of the lost rites.’ One asked me if the mounds can speak.

“I told them: the mounds remember. That was a mistake. Now they burn herbs and whisper to the roots as if they’ll answer.

They believe the gods are asleep. That the old man is a door. That blood might wake memory.”

They are wrong. But they are trying. And that is more than I can say for the world outside.



## Trade in the Vine-Market

_Location_: Water-stained scrap tucked in a hollowed-out mask mold  
_Time_: During her visits to the proto-Taker camps

They call it the Vine-Market—bare roots lashed into tables, old idols used to weigh fungus. Goblins, deserters, even a one-eyed Selvean trading green-glow balm for rusted charms.

They warned me not to go deeper. One said: ‘The further you walk, the more your memories grow legs.’ Another spat behind him three times and said Mama Yaya walks when the frogs sing.

They believe in nothing, yet fear everything. They laugh at the mask-wearers, but sleep with knives and salt under their pillows.

Survival here has become a kind of faith.



## The Offering

_Location_: Hidden beneath a stone in the drowned shrine chamber  
_Time_: Just before Oraya’s possession

I came here for memory. To gather what my people left behind. But this place… it remembers _me_.

The path was wrong. I followed root-threads, not trails. Found this chamber breathing, not echoing. It was never meant to be found by feet.

He was waiting. Not the old man. Not a man at all. I do not know what I saw—only that it smiled without a mouth.

He asked for my name. I gave it.



## Reflection (Half Reclaimed)

_Location_: Partially eaten by moss, found near the Dream-Eater frog’s basin  
_Time_: Weeks after becoming Mama Yaya (still partially lucid)

They call me Yaya now. The Takers whisper it, the zealots chant it, the jungle _says_ it when the vines hiss.

I walk the Mounds and they bow—not to me, but to the silence behind me.

I remember the girl who sang for the old man. I remember the song. I remember her hands. But not her name.

What I gave was not a mistake. What I became… I do not regret. Only this: that no one left here knows the difference.




## On the Takers (I)
They dig with reverence they won’t admit.
They spit on the cultists, but won’t touch a mask without muttering a charm. They mock rituals—then wear shards of sacred wood as trinkets because it ‘sells better that way.’
Their economy is built on desecration. But some of them, I think, hope the jungle is watching—and that it might forgive them if they smile while stealing.



## On the Takers (II)

They are not a people. They are a symptom.

Orphans of too many wars. Runaways from three different gods. They do not know how to grow—only how to carve.

But I have seen moments. One helped a Maskbearer child escape a snake-vine. Another left sweetroot beside the Grand Mask. They may be robbers, but they are not beyond grace.



## On the Maskbearers (I)

They frighten me most when they are gentle.

Their rites are not born of cruelty, but yearning. They want to remember so badly, they will bleed to do it. They mistake suffering for sanctity.

They believe the mounds must be fed. That memory must be loud. But memory, in truth, is quiet. Gentle. Like moss.



## On the Maskbearers (II)

They do not understand the old ways. But they believe in them harder than I ever dared.

They build temples from fragments. They mimic ancestral chants with broken syllables and tears in their eyes.

Sometimes I want to correct them. Sometimes I want to kneel beside them and cry.



## On the Vine-Taken (I)

They are not monsters. They are aftermath.

They do not hunt. They do not speak. They _become_. The ones that were once human move like vines remembering how to be ribs.

One touched my shoulder once. I smelled lavender. And salt.



## On the Vine-Taken (II)

If the Hollow is the jungle dreaming, then the Vine-Taken are what it dreams of.

They gather near the fallen mask not as pilgrims, but as roots seeking home. I think they remember being held.

I have not dared to sleep near them.



## On the Selveans’ Influence

They brought order, then ritual, then blood.

Their generals spoke of efficiency. Their priests brought steel-chants and scar-scoring rites. The Maskbearers absorbed all of it—and forgot what was theirs.

Every time I see a ceremonial groove carved with Selvean glyphs, I want to scream. But I am too tired.



## On the Grand Mask
They say it fell in a storm. I think it was dropped.
It does not rot. It does not crack. But it hums when the moon is half-hidden.
The Maskbearers believe it houses the Drowsy One. The Takers think it _is_ Mama Yaya. Neither is wrong.



## On the Fragmented Line
They do not know that the bloodline of the mounds still breathes.
I see my father in the curve of a carved mask. I see Lanternhead in the roots beneath my bed. My son bears none of it on his face—but all of it in his bones.
When they learn who I am, it will either save them—or damn me.

## On What They All Forget

No one asks what the mounds want.
They treat them as altar, fortress, god, or tradepost. They never ask what it is like to be _remembered wrong_.
I dream sometimes that I am a mound. Full of old breath. And everyone keeps calling me by the wrong name.
