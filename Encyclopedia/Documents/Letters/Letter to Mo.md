My dearest Mo,

I’ll be off with the caravan soon and I decided to put my thoughts in writing. You know how my memory can be!

I’ve entrusted the daily running of orphanage to Chalchi. I believe she will be a capable and steady force around here. 

I know that you will be keeping an eye on the children too. You’ve always had a knack for wriggling out of trouble and those little troublemakers will need that skill. I'm ever grateful for all the times you've helped me with them.

But listen to me now, child. Don't forget to look after yourself as well, and to live your own life. Over the years, many have left but you've always stayed near, caring for the younger ones. Now it is time to find people who care for you. You don't have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders alone. You can make your
own way, but you don't have to do it on your own. 

Look at me now, embarking on a journey to see an old friend. These things matter. And when I return in a few weeks, we’ll have much to discuss. There are things I’ve been meaning tell you, and perhaps this trip will help me put those thoughts in order.

My point is: 
Everyone has a song and yours deserves to be heard. If you miss me while I'm gone, look at the night sky and you'll know I'll also be watching. 

Don't worry yourself over me though. I'm a tough lady travelling with a convoy, nothing could be safer. And I've already packed my tonics!

Take care, child
Granny Moon
