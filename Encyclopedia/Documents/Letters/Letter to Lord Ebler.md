Dear Lord Ebler,

I write once again to ask you to send reinforcements to our outpost. The last member of the local Mer resistance has been captured but my men have all succumbed to a strange disease. My calls for help have gone unanswered.

I was supposed to be relieved of duty three years ago now and my dedication is waning. I have worked tirelessly to maintain the ship but my health has been declining. I fear that if I do not receive reinforcements soon, I will have no other choice but to sail back home and hand you my resignation in person.

Sincerely,
