My dear Solveig,

It has been far too long since our last meeting in Harboursjaw, and I find myself thinking often of our old conversations. 

Time moves forward, and with it, new growth emerges from ancient soil. I have finally uncovered the thing I sought all those years ago. There are those here who recognise its value, but they do not yet understand its full meaning. I believe you are one of the few who might.

I will be in Isernholt for a short time and we should meet where we once did. I know the roads are not always kind, but I trust you will find the best way to travel them. It would please me greatly to see you again, my honoured friend, to speak of past and future. 

Yours always,
Bryn
