campaign: "[[A Province on the Edge]]"
---
Lanternhead was brought for a private audience with the High Priest. Named Split-Tongue, he was enclosed in a large Tetzilwahi mask with a snake tongue. He explained that the blood Lanternhead had shed during his offering had triggered a response in the jungle: this place recognised him. Eager to learn from Lanternhead's memories, he offered to guide him through a ritual of recovery. He released bioluminescent spores within the room and instructed Lanternhead to sacrifice blood. 

After cutting himself, Lanternhead was transported to the past, where he inhabited the body of an older woman carrying research notes about the ruins. He encountered a group of people in the canopy, including a younger Petrified who had just carved a stone mask. They seemed friendly and addressed the old woman as Yaya. 

Shedding more blood, Lanternhead found himself in a different body: that of a younger drow, but definitely his. He explored a thriving Tetzilwahi settlement, inhabited by community of drow living within the plant mounds and honouring them. He spoke briefly with his daughter before being pulled back to reality. As Split-Tongue questioned him about his visions, he remained evasive. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the party had defeated the bandits led by Farra. They questioned her and learned that she had previously been a soldier in the Steorrian army and found refuge in the jungle with a few friends after deserting. The group had grown over the years and their methods seemed opportunistic and ruthless. Farra invited the party to visit their market under the protection of the Green Veil, offering resources and information. After much deliberation, the party agreed to free the prisoners and visit their camp, but not before finding Lanternhead. Farra made a point of bringing bodies back with her so they wouldn't become Vine-Taken, the aggressive plant people who produced psychoactive spores. 

Back in the sacrifice chamber, Lanterhead had had enough of the cult and tried to wrestle the mask off Split-Tongue when he pushed for more blood memory. The High Priest attempted but failed to stab him then called for reinforcements. As masked fighters ran in, Lanternheard blasted a hole through the wall with fire magic to escape. This coincided with the arrival of the party, who rushed to their friend's aid. The whole mound caught fire and a chaotic fight ensued, during which many mask bearers including the High Priest were downed. Their number still too great, the party fled, running though the jungle.

Of course! Based on the discussion, here is a clear recap of what most likely happened in the last session.
Session Recap: Visions, Bandits, and a Fiery Escape
The session found the party split, with Lanternhead facing the mysteries of the Maskbearer cult while the rest of the group dealt with the aftermath of their fight with a band of jungle survivalists.
The Party and the Survivors:
Following their battle, the party engaged in a tense negotiation with the leader of the bandits. They learned that the group is composed of deserters from the Steorrian Army and other survivors of the war, now living off the land. Their raids are a matter of survival, and they have established a hidden market deep in the jungle to barter for goods.
The party inquired about the strange cultists and the children they had seen. The bandit leader confirmed the existence of children wearing black wooden masks, who are being raised collectively by the community and do not know their biological parents. After expressing interest in visiting the market, the party observed the bandits collecting their dead. The bandits explained this was necessary to prevent the jungle from converting the bodies into monstrous creatures they call the "Vine-Taken". The party realized these creatures are the source of the spores the bandits have been harvesting and using.
Lanternhead's Ordeal:
Meanwhile, the Maskbearers subjected Lanternhead to a ritual. After cutting himself, he was plunged into a series of visions that were not his own memories:
 * First Vision: He experienced the life of a woman, Oraya II, a researcher who studied the lost Tetzilwahi culture. Through her eyes, he understood that the Maskbearers were trying to emulate a culture they knew nothing about and that he, Lanternhead, was their only true link to this past. He also learned of a figure named Mama Yaya, who seemed to be a guide or leader to the cultists.
 * Second Vision: He saw a vision of a more prosperous past, where he was a father to a daughter named Oraya.
Shaken by these revelations, Lanternhead confronted one of the cult's leaders, denouncing their practices as a "childish and perverse" imitation of his people's culture. Enraged, the cultist attacked. Lanternhead turned invisible to escape but was cornered inside one of the great mounds. Left with no choice, he dropped his invisibility and unleashed his magic, setting the chamber ablaze and burning a hole through the wall, through which he levitated to safety.
The two groups reconvened just as Lanternhead made his dramatic escape, finding themselves in a tense standoff with the remaining bandits.
