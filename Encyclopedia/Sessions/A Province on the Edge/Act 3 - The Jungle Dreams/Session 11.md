campaign: "[[A Province on the Edge]]"

Lanternhead was taken by the Maskbearers after the Mounds reacted to his blood. He has not been seen since, said to be in audience with the cult's high priest.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party remained with the Maskbearers and learned more about the group’s strange beliefs. They heard of a higher power called the **Drowsy One**, a godlike entity said to sleep beneath the jungle, and learned of the **Grand Mound**, a sacred site now contested between factions.

**Biggs**, when prompted to give an offering to earn a mask of his own, chose to give up all his gold—symbolically rejecting his old life of privilege. In return, he received a silver mask with red rhinestones, which grants the power to cast _charm person_ once per day.

The party was then asked to deal with a **Taker warband** occupying a nearby mound. They accepted and set out.

The Takers had built their base atop three massive, fallen tree trunks, 60 feet in the air, connected by walkways. **Vic** approached first, claiming they were merchants—successfully getting the bandits to descend, but then wasted the opportunity by boasting about being the deadliest man alive, which shattered the ruse.

Combat broke out. **Yasmin**, unleashing the power of her mask, transformed into a panther and tore through the enemy with terrifying speed and precision. Several bandits died—one fell, one had a heart attack, one was slain directly. Others were rendered unconscious and tied up. **Mo** objected to the violence, questioning the morality of the mission.

Among the captives was **Farah**, leader of the warband, who fought fiercely before being paralysed. Her daughter was also among the prisoners. The session ended with **both Farah and her daughter tied up**, and tensions high.

Unbeknownst to the others, **Yasmin discovered notes written by Mama Yaya (Oraya II)** hidden within the mound but has yet to share this with the group.
