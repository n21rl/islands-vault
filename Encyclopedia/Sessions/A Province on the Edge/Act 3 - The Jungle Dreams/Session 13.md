To Vic's dismay, Mo parted with the gun she had confiscated from Jeffrey. However, the words she obtained in exchange allowed the party to acquire enchanted weapons. 

The group was brought to meet the leader of the Takers, who offered them a deal: to aid in the upcoming assault on the Grand Mound, currently contested by the Maskbearers, the Vine-Taken, and the Takers themselves. In exchange, she promised safe passage and cooperation. The party agreed.

She also asked them to remove a group of children raised by the Maskbearers—young, masked initiates kept apart from the outside world.

Vic sided with Lanternhead, but Mo and Biggs, though not active participants in the session, were both said to oppose the idea. With no clear consensus, the party agreed to postpone the decision until after the battle.
