summary: The group meets an old bugbear survivor of the Curse and hunts a Dream Eater frog
---

With only two days before the caravan was due to leave, the group set off into the jungle, hoping to reach the bugbear village, learn more about Biggs’ curse, and make it back in time. Yazmin helped track their way, but she wasn’t the only one guiding them. As they crossed into the Green Veil, they heard a clear, magical voice in their minds. It let them know they were being watched, that their presence was noted, and that no life could be taken while inside. That message repeated if you came back in again, and the trees around them felt very much alive—like they were listening.

As they pushed deeper, they came across a messy clearing filled with overlapping tracks. It looked like some kind of struggle had taken place—someone had been walking upright, then running on all fours, then dragged away. It had all the signs of the curse, or at least something close. Yasmin talked to the birds and managed to figure out which way the bugbear village probably was, and they left the scene behind to head in that direction.

Not long after, they spotted a lone bugbear digging at the base of a tree. He was hairless, strange-looking, and the group wasn’t sure if they’d have to fight him. But he didn’t act hostile, so they approached. Biggs recognized that the bugbear was speaking Goblin and started talking to him. The bugbear, whose name was Oldum, was calm and thoughtful. He told them he’d survived the curse by outlasting it—just waiting it out alone. He also told them that the village wouldn’t let Biggs in because of the infection.

There was another way, though. Oldum spoke about the Dream Eater—a jungle spirit tied to dreams and rest. According to him, the only way to be cured was to go to its domain and fall asleep. The Dream Eater would come to you—he made it clear that you didn’t hunt it, it hunted you. Sometimes it was green, sometimes red, but always with a huge mouth. The group decided to trust Oldum and head toward the Dream Eater’s resting place.

They eventually found a quiet jungle pond. Something about it was wrong—the reflection showed the night sky even though it was still daytime. They realized that drinking the water or entering it would put someone to sleep. Yasmin spoke to a fish in the pond and learned that the Dream Eater was probably a frog. Unsure if sleep was necessary, the group eventually all lay down and drifted off one by one.

That’s when the Dream Eater arrived. It was a massive frog, and it tried to swallow Vic whole, waking the group. A fight broke out. Most of them were ready to take it down, but Mo held back. She didn’t want to kill it. Instead, she managed to slice off a chunk of its flesh—just enough. Badly wounded, the creature began to magically leap away into the forest. Lanternhead didn’t hesitate—he chased after it. Yasmin followed. Back at the pond, Vic stayed behind with Mo to watch over Biggs while the others vanished into the trees.
