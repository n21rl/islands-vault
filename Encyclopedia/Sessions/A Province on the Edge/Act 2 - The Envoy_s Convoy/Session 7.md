The group found Jeffrey camped out in the Free Range. He was angry and paranoid, firing his gun when they approached, but was quickly subdued—Lanternhead vanished into a rope trick, Yasmine held him with _Hold Person_, and Mo disarmed him with _Heat Metal_. The fight lasted less than a round.

Jeffrey wasn’t responsible for Poppa’s disappearance. He was bitter about being pushed out of Stormchaser Ranch and suspicious the Selveans had poisoned the Runners, but had no proof. The group sent Biggs back to the ranch to fetch Gorvan, hoping he could talk Jeffrey into leaving peacefully.

That night, strange thunder echoed across the Range—deeper and louder than any storm. A group of agitated Runners appeared, led by a young alpha with red feathers. Unsure if they were hostile, the group held back until a fight broke out. Lanternhead cast _Speak with Animals_ and challenged the alpha. After a brief clash and a flash of magic, the Runners submitted. Lanternhead became their leader and mounted the red-feathered alpha.

The others escorted Jeffrey back to the convoy, smuggling him into the medicine wagon with Vic’s help. Yasmine was granted access to him under the guise of medical care.

Meanwhile, Lanternhead stayed behind. He followed the thunder deeper into the Range and discovered a group of Jawists performing a storm ritual—calling down thunder and trying to summon something with Runner calls. He didn’t intervene. Instead, he led the Runners to the edge of the Free Range, blasted a hole in the fence, and set them free.

He rejoined the convoy days later—not just as a masked outsider, but as someone the Runners now followed.
