The convoy cuts through the jungle and Biggs catches a dangerous disease


With the convoy heading north, the party gained access to the medicine wagon. While helping Geoffrey, who had grown reclusive and refused food, Yasmine and Mo examined the supplies. Hidden among the medicine, they discovered a sealed metal box and a letter addressed to Lady Netta, bearing official markings—hinting at high-level political involvement in the convoy's mission.

Meanwhile, Lanternhead, still disguised, attempted to learn more about Geoffrey’s condition and was given a vague warning about an ancient legend—something about a creature or presence known as Chippa, said to dwell deep in the Jaw’s jungle.

The next day, Gorvan presented the party with a choice: take the long road to Isernholt, or cut through the jungle to save time. Despite ominous mentions of monsters and bugbear sightings, the party chose the jungle shortcut.

While traveling, they spotted strange tracks—like bugbear prints, but dry, cracked, and unnatural. Before long, they were ambushed by five monstrous figures. Though humanoid in shape, they were gaunt, hairless, with leathery skin—former bugbears, twisted by Wardog’s Curse.

In the brutal fight that followed, Biggs was bitten and wounded. The creatures were defeated, but it soon became clear that the curse had taken hold: Biggs grew increasingly agitated, lashing out even at allies, including Lanternhead. The party calmed him, but symptoms were worsening.

Yasmine diagnosed the condition. The disease—likely spread by infected animals and fur—appeared to particularly affect those with more body hair. Though no cure was known among the convoy, some jungle communities might hold ancient knowledge of how to treat it.

Realizing the danger, the party made a fateful decision: they would leave the convoy behind and head east, seeking a bugbear village rumored to exist deeper in the jungle. With time running short, they hoped to find a cure for Biggs—before the curse consumed him completely.
