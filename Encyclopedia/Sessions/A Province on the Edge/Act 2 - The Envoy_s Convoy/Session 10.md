Following the Trail of the Dream Eater:
After a series of tense encounters, the party tracked the strange Dream Eater—a large, sacred frog spirit—through the jungle. As they approached the Tetzilwahi ruins, Jasmine took a bite from the creature just before it transformed into light and vanished. In its place, a mysterious woman’s voice echoed, offering help and urging them to “follow the light.”

Arrival at the Ruins:
The party continued into the ruins. Yasmine and Lanternhead led the way through vines and overgrowth. They encountered signs of habitation and eventually stumbled upon masked figures—members of the Maskbearers cult, including goblins and others they couldn’t identify. These figures spoke of their devotion to the “Path of Masks” and posed a question to the adventurers: “What are you willing to offer?”

Blood and Revelation:
In response, Lanternhead gave so much blood he collapsed. Yasmine, determined and resolute, gave half her vitality. Biggs gave some, but not as much. Mo and others did not offer blood. The Maskbearers deemed Yasmine the most worthy and led her alone to a mysterious chamber known as the Hall of the Unworn Masks.

The Bone Mask:
Within the Hall, Yasmine passed rows of masks—each resting upon the wall, each filled with a strange, quiet presence. As she ran her hands across them, she stopped on one made of bone, shaped like a skull. Her hand stuck fast, unwilling or unable to pull away. Something passed between her and the mask.

Whispers in the Vines:
Meanwhile, Lanternhead had fallen into a different part of the ruins, a vine-choked level just above the others. There, faint whispers surrounded him—no longer the woman’s voice, but something older, murmuring in a forgotten tongue.

Ominous Signs and Subtle Shifts:
Biggs . Though he didn’t feel better after their encounter with the frog, he also didn’t feel worse—an eerie stillness settled over his condition. The light they had followed was now gone, but faint whispers in a strange tongue echoed from deeper within the ruins. The jungle itself seemed to pulse with ancient memory.
