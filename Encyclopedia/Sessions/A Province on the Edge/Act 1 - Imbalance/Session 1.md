The fire at the Pisswater Inn raged, but quick thinking and cooperation saved the day. Mo and Lanternhead used their charisma and illusion magic to imitate Champions, including the influential Akalan, and direct the crowd effectively. Biggs meanwhile relied on raw strength to hold the flames at bay. Though the inn was ravaged, the building avoided complete destruction, the fire did not spread further, and all patrons and staff survived. As the flames subsided, Vic was pulled away by a mysterious man. 

Later that day, Mo's attention was drawn by an altercation at an altar, where Selveans and Steorrians were shouting accusations at each other. Fearing the orphans may be involved, she rushed forward and indeed found six-year-old halfling Davi at the centre of the crowd. A Selvean priestess was accusing him of theft, while a plump Steorrian woman led the charge against the Selveans, claiming they were scapegoating the child and practicing barbaric rituals. Pressured by Mo, Davi admitted he and Durz, a teenage orc girl, had stolen fruit from the altar. The priestess insisted more had been taken but refused to reveal what. 

The argument simmered until Granny Moon arrived, guided by Durz. With her years of connection to both communities, she chastised both sides and urged them to seek peace. She scolded the Steorrians for their ignorance, as Selvean blood rituals were voluntary, however foreign they might seem. The tension diffused and the Steorrians left. Before leaving with the children, she privately urged Mo to seek new allies for support, hinting that Biggs and Lanternhead might be worthy of that trust. The two had followed Mo to the altar, ready to intervene if the situation turned sour. Magically disguised as a young elf, Lanternhead stepped toward the altar and spilled some of his blood into the ritual bowl before leaving without a word

In an effort to get to know Biggs and Lanternhead, Mo brought them to *Puss in Boots*, a seedy tavern frequented by those who preferred to remain unseen. Biggs revealed his intent to take part in the Champions' Tournament, a grand competition organised to showcase the variety of fighting styles of the Jaw. Winners would get the chance of becoming Champions themselves, a lifelong dream of Biggs. Lanternhead remained more of a mystery. He scribbled "Tetzilwahi" onto a piece of parchment, perhaps the name of his lost homeland. The trio was interrupted by a shady character who wanted to offer them a job and a drink. Sensing trouble, they threw the stingy ale in his face and absconded in the ensuing commotion.

The next day, Biggs officially entered the Tournament as a Blood Path contestant. This was the portion of the Tournament celebrating physical prowess, while the Spirit Path focused on magic. With Mo and Lanternhead cheering Biggs on, he tackled the first event: a brutal obstacle course on the outskirts of the city. His strength and determination shining through, he excelled and earned himself a spot in the following stage.
