The tournament's team bracket continued, with Biggs, Vic, Yavlini, and Halron competing in another match. Their teamwork and skill brought them victory, advancing them to the next stage: a free-for-all. During the intense fight, Vic and Biggs occasionally worked together, having grown to respect one another. Ultimately, Yavlini and Vic were defeated, leaving Halron and Biggs to move on. Yasmine discreetly assisted Halron during the match, while Mo supported Biggs. When they noticed each other’s interference, tensions flared, leading to a heated argument. The champions intervened to defuse the situation, but the conflict remained unresolved.

Later, Mo confronted Yasmine in the Oriental Quarter, accusing her of aiding someone dangerous. Yasmine tried to justify her actions but couldn’t fully shake her guilt. Meanwhile, Lanternhead explored Harboursjaw, appearing unsettled by the city’s contrasts and complexities.

That night, everyone went their separate ways, but the peace didn’t last. Mo was awoken in the orphanage by [a disturbing and horrifying scene involving Granny Moon]. Acting quickly, she roused the children and evacuated them, locking the room behind her before running to seek Paxitli’s help.



The Champions Tournament rages on with the second team bracket match. Biggs, Vic, Yavlini, and Halron face fierce opponents but emerge victorious, earning a place in the next stage—a brutal free-for-all. As the battle unfolds, Vic and Biggs form an unlikely alliance, their growing bond tested in the arena. By the end, Vic and Yavlini are defeated, leaving Biggs and Halron to advance. But the fight is not without intrigue: Yasmine secretly aids Halron under orders from Gristle, while Mo lends her support to Biggs. The two spot each other’s interference, leading to a tense confrontation as mutual suspicions grow.

Later, Mo confronts Yasmine in the city’s Oriental district, accusing her of enabling a dangerous criminal like Halron, who was involved in the Pisswater fire. Yasmine defends her actions, but Mo’s words clearly strike a nerve. Meanwhile, Lanternhead explores Harboursjaw under Mo’s guidance, his alien presence underscoring his uneasy place in this divided city. As the day ends, the group disperses, with Vic retreating to his wife and the others resting uneasily after the tournament’s chaos.

In the dead of night, terror strikes. Mo wakes to the metallic scent of blood, her face damp with its touch. Following the crimson trail, she discovers Granny Moon’s lifeless body in a horrific scene of slaughter. Blood pools across the floor, staining the orphanage with death. In a rush of panic and resolve, Mo locks the door to Granny’s room, gathers the children, and evacuates them into the cold dawn. With her heart racing, she runs to Paxitli, desperate for aid as Harboursjaw’s fragile balance teeters on the edge of chaos.
