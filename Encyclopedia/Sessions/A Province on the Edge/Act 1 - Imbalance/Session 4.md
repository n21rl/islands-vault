The investigation of Granny Moon's murder begins and the Champions Tournament ends

The session opened on a flashback: the night before, Biggs had attended the Champions’ feast. He drank from the communal bowl of **Nectar**, a ceremonial drink made from fermented fruit and Blue Star flowers. It hit him hard—visions, dizziness, pulsing lights—and though he stayed a while, he eventually slipped away to sleep it off in the orphanage basement. Just before leaving, he saw Akalan rush away as a commotion broke out.

Back in the present, **Mo ran to Paxitli’s estate**, demanding help. The Champions at the gate were slow to act, but the moment she said Granny Moon was dead, she was brought inside. Paxitli met her privately. There were no healers available after a riot the night before, so they sent for **Yasmine** instead. Mo wasn’t happy about that, but accepted it.

Meanwhile, **Ronnie had told Chalchee** that Mo had woken the children and cleared them out in the early morning. He also remembered hearing a thud and hurried footsteps during the night. Chalchee sent **Vic** back to the orphanage, while she took the children to the arena.

**Mo and Akalan returned to the orphanage**, where everything was as she left it—except for one thing: someone had written the word **“Traitor”** in blood on the wall. Shortly after, Yasmine and Zaiban arrived. **Yasmine inspected the body**, confirming that Granny had been killed hours earlier by a blade that **cut through her chest and aorta**, causing her to bleed out internally. One side of the wound was more ragged, suggesting the blade was yanked or curved.

**Vic and Biggs inspected the grounds**, and Lanternhead found a **deep footprint beneath a window**, likely from someone escaping. Near it, Biggs found a **modified Steorrian coin**. Its meaning wasn’t clear. The group began to suspect a **Selvean blood ritual**, especially with the **ritual knife stolen back in Session 1** still missing. The style of wound and the fact that Granny was a respected elder pointed to something ceremonial—but didn’t fully make sense.

**Vic found a bundle of letters**, one for each child and a few others. He gave Mo hers but kept the others—for now. **Biggs found a half-burned letter addressed to Solveig**—Granny’s real name—warning her to travel discreetly to **Isernholt**, where someone had found something important. Mo also discovered a **talisman in Granny’s hand**, a circle with four directional lines. Lanternhead recognised it, but couldn’t recall from where.

Despite the chaos, the **final match of the Champions Tournament** went ahead. Mo convinced Biggs to fight. She and Lanternhead stayed behind, preparing food and beginning funeral plans. Vic returned to Chalchee to deliver the news.

At the arena, the final match took place on a raised platform.

- **Palomi was eliminated early**.
- **Biggs and Teya teamed up to bring down Halron**, finally knocking him out of the tournament.
- In the end, **Tae-ah emerged as the winner**, claiming the title of Champion.
    

Back at the orphanage, the dust hadn’t settled. Granny Moon was dead, and no one knew why. But her letters, the burned message, and the staff in Isernholt all hinted that something bigger was underway. The mystery was only beginning.

➢ The Champions are partying with the tournament victors
➢ There is a large bowl filled with a drink that is being passed around to everyone
➢ Akalan - champion (bulky male elf) - tells Bigs that the drink is called Nectar
○ Usually drank by people of high-status
○ Made from a variety of fruits as well as the nectar of Blue Star Flowers - which is where it gets its name from
○ Akalan offers Bigs a drink, which he takes
➢ The victors of the Spirit path are also present
○ Palonni - non-binary elf
○ Tae-ah - female elf that uses divine magic
■ An opportunity for her to join the champions because for some reason she previously couldn’t - very motivated
➢ During his conversation with Akalan, Bigs learns that if he wins and decides to become a champion - Tzecto, the Leader of the Champions - will determine what comes next for him
➢ Suddenly Bigs hears drums playing and realises that it’s his heart
○ He starts seeing double as well as flashing lights - my guy is tripping balls
○ He stays for a while with Akalan, before going to leave
○ As he leaves, he notices a commotion that Akalan runs off to deal with
➢ Bigs makes it back to the orphanage to sleep in the basement with Lantern Head


Back to current time
Mo runs to Paxitli’s office? Building? - and is stopped by two champions at the gate, when Mo tells them that Granny Moon is dead, they go talk to Paxitli
➢ Mo is brought to a meeting room
➢ Paxitli is a non-binary elf, ochre skin, green hair with an undercut on one side, and androgynous features
○ Has a tendency to rub the shaved part of their hair
➢ Mo recounts what happened and how she found Granny - they agree to send champions and a healer
○ Due to the brawl in the night, there are no healers available, so Paxitli decides to reach out to Yasmine - Mo is not happy about this, but has to deal
Meanwhile, Ronnie runs to Chalchee and Vic’s as the festival is not open yet
➢ Tells them that Mo was acting really weird and cleared everyone out of the orphanage
➢ He heard a thud and then what sounded like running in the night
➢ Chalchee asks Vic to check out the orphanage while she tries to find the other orphans
Zaiban (another Champion) goes to get Yasmine - doesn’t really inform her of what she is walking into
Mo and Akalan arrive back to the orphanage first
➢ Mo remembers to warn Akalan about Lantern Head and Bigs before entering
➢ The scene was as Mo left it, but now she notices the word “Traitor” written on the wall in blood
Next Yasmine arrives with Zaiban - realises that there is nothing she can do for Granny
➢ Mo threatens Yasmine before letting her work - but does not intervene after that point
➢ Yasmine casts Gentle Repose and Detect Poison (I think)
➢ Examines the wound - the main source of the blood
○ A horizontal line across her chest - but there is one side where the wound is more torn
○ Severed her aorta from the inside - blood pooled inside her, before spilling out
○ Granny was killed maybe 5 or 6 hours ago
Bigs and Vic go to the window and notice that it looks like someone jumped out from there - indentation in the mud
➢ Lantern Head goes down to investigate
➢ Indentation does not appear to have been made by a halfling or gnome - do much of an imprint
➢ Also finds a Steorrian coin that appears to be modified in some way
Killing and wound appear to be ritualistic
➢ Yasmine asks Zaiban about the wound - it does appear similar to sacrificial wounds used in the Selvean Bloodletting rituals
○ Recall missing knife from Selvean ritual in Session 1
➢ Akalan provides a bit more information regarding Selvean Bloodletting
○ Old rituals had both voluntary sacrifice and forced sacrifice - but that is no longer practiced
○ Forced sacrifices were usually nobles or opposing soldiers - these were considered worthy sacrifices
○ Criminals and outlaws would not have been considered worthy
○ But this was all in old Selvean - before the Great Burning (need to get a bit more info on this)
➢ He also provides insight into the commotion the previous night
○ There was a fight between Selvean elven purists and Steorrians
○ Selveans believe that blood is powerful
■ Purists believe that specifically Selvean elven blood is the most powerful
Investigating the blood message - seems like it was written by someone where the lettering is not natural for them - they had to consider it
➢ Salvean lettering is similar to pictographs - very different to Steorrian
Vic finds letters addressed to all the orphans
➢ Hands Mo her letter and takes Ronnie and Chalchee’s letters to deliver to them
➢ Mo reads her letter, but does not share its contents
Bigs notices something in the fire - pulls out a burnt letter
➢ Addressed to Solveig - might be Granny’s name - no confirmation, just inferred
➢ States that:
○ They have discovered things they sought
○ Want to meet with ‘Granny’?
○ Few who might be aware, but most are not
○ Should travel with someone/something to Isenhold
■ Mountain area up North - general area Granny was travelling to
Paxitli’s relationship with Granny and the orphanage - they donate money to feed the orphans, and allowed Granny to remain in charge, even after Selvea reclaimed the Jaw
Mo finds a talisman that Granny was clutching when she died
➢ Looks almost like a target with lines at the cardinal points
➢ Lantern Head has seen the symbol before, but has no idea where
➢ Mo keeps the talisman
Yasmine leaves - needs to prepare for the tournament final
Bigs contemplates not competing, but in the end decides to go after some convincing from Mo
Mo and Lantern Head stay in the orphanage
➢ Lantern Head prepare food so they have something to come home to
➢ Mo starts to prepare funeral arrangements for Granny
Vic returns to Chalchee and informs her of what happened to Granny
➢ Chalchee has found some of the other orphans, so Vic decides to keep Ronnie’s letter for the time being
➢ He gives Chalchee her letter
➢ Chalchee takes everyone to the tournament
The final round of the tournament takes place on a platform
➢ Paloni is taken out swiftly
➢ Bigs teams up with Tae-ah to take out Halron - woo!!
➢ Tae-ah is the outright winner of the tournament
