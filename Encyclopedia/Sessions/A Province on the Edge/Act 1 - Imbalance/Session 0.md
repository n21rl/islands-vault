The Festival of Balance, a grand Selvean celebration held every twelve years, was just beginning in the city of Harboursjaw. Paxitli, the Selvean Envoy overseeing the region, hoped the event would ease tensions between the various groups of the Jaw.

At the bustling Pisswater Inn, the Steorrian Victor was on duty as hired security. Tasked by the owner Marcus to find additional help during the festival, Vic enlisted the bugbear Biggs who had been staying at the inn. Biggs had recently arrived in town, after leaving a quiet life in Selvea. His companion, Lanternhead, a silent and eerie figure, watched from the shadows as usual.

Meanwhile, the young elf Mo had been asked by Granny Moon to keep an eye on the five children from the orphanage. She strategically paired them up and gave them spending money for the festival, keeping ten-year-old Ronnie by her side. At his request, they stopped by the Pisswater Inn to watch the Selvean band performing on stage.

While scanning the room, Mo caught sight of a dwarf and an elf glaring at the band from a corner. But it was another pair of Steorrian patrons who opened the hostilities by throwing drinks at the performers. 

As Vic and Biggs quickly moved to handle the troublemakers, the suspicious dwarf and elf seized the opportunity and hurled lanterns to the ground, starting a fire that sent the inn into a panic.

Vic and Biggs subdued the remaining aggressors, while Mo focused on ensuring Ronnie's safety amid the chaos. Together, they helped everyone escape, but the flames continued to spread...
