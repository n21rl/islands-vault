Second round - team combat
➢ Team: Bigs, Vic, Halronl, Yavlini


As the Champions Tournament continued, Biggs defeated a minor Air Elemental and advanced to the next stage. Vic was given a covert task by Gristle, his contact within the Hammer—ensure the success of Halron, a redheaded dwarf who had paid for vy. Yasmine, a recently arrived Steorrian gnome healer, was hired by the same gang to do the same from within the medical ranks of the tournament.

Yasmine’s first impression of Lanternhead was strange to say the least: the silent figure attempted to sneak into the arena disguised as an elderly man and was intercepted by a Champion. She claimed he was delivering herbs; Lanternhead handed her an illusory bag of herbs and vanished, leaving her with more questions than answers.

Outside the arena, tensions rose. Selvean protestors blocked Steorrian contestants from entering. Mo avoided the fray and secured a good seat. Vic, however, was spit on and responded with fists, joined swiftly by Biggs. Yasmine guarded Halron as chaos erupted. Champions sided with the protestors—until Granny Moon arrived. Chastising both sides, she reminded them of Paxitli’s vision of coexistence, and smoothed the way for Vic and Biggs to enter.

Before the team event, Lanternhead and Yasmine independently tampered with the roster, ensuring Halron, Vic, and Biggs would fight together. The final teammate drawn was Yavlini, a silent Selvean warrior who fought with precise brutality.

In the team battle, Biggs impressed again, Vic held the line, and Halron played to the crowd. Mo, watching from the stands, recognized Halron as one of the arsonists behind the Pisswater fire—but Vic had yet to realize. The team emerged victorious, but secrets and tensions simmered just beneath the surface.




**Gristle**, capo of the **Hammer Gang**, secretly tasks **Vic** and **Yasmine** with ensuring that **Halron** reaches the final of the tournament. Their mission, involves keeping a close eye on Halron as he fights his way through the brackets.

Meanwhile, outside the tournament grounds, a **protest** erupted as **Selvean Purists** rally against the inclusion of non-Selveans in the competition. This protest intensifies the divisions between the people of Harboursjaw.

**Granny Moon**, concerned about the growing instability, offers **Biggs** and **Lanternhead** a safe place to stay at the orphanage, seeking to shield them from the unrest. Her hospitality underscores her maternal role in the lives of those around her, especially in times of rising tension.vvvvv


The day of the Champions Tournament began with shadowy dealings behind the scenes. Vic met with Gristle, an orc representative of the Hammer gang, who revealed that Halron, a red-haired dwarf and fellow competitor, had paid the Hammer for an advantage. Gristle informed Vic that his entry into the tournament’s combat trials was secured by the gang, but he was now tasked with ensuring Halron’s safety and success—ideally seeing him reach the final, if not outright winning. Separately, Gristle enlisted Yasmine, a Steorrian outcast and gnome healer, to favour Halron during the tournament.

As the day progressed, Biggs arrived early to prepare, while Vic headed to the arena. Outside, he was confronted by a group of Selvean Purist protesters, who denounced the inclusion of non-Selveans and non-elves in the tournament, citing that the winners could become Champions. The situation escalated when one protester spat in Vic’s face, leading to a fight. Halron used the commotion to retreat into the safety of the arena, avoiding the chaos. Biggs stepped in to support Vic, and the two managed to handle the situation until the Champions themselves intervened. However, the Champions merely restrained Vic, offering little help in defusing the broader conflict.

Granny Moon arrived amidst the tension, scolding the Purists for their divisive behaviour and advocating for unity. She also offered Biggs and Lanternhead a safe place to stay in the basement of the orphanage, further cementing her role as a mediator and protector of the party.

The tournament trials began with individual combat. Biggs proved his mettle by defeating an air elemental, using his strength and resilience to win and secure his spot in the next round.

Later, during the team combat phase, Lanternhead used his magic to influence the team selection, ensuring that Biggs and Vic ended up on the same team with strong allies. Yasmine, following her instructions from the Hammer, manipulated the line-up further, ensuring Halron was on Vic's team as well. Their last teammate was Yavlini, a Selvean elf armed with javelins and a sword, who proved herself a deadly and efficient warrior.

During the battle, Biggs’ strength and teamwork played a crucial role in the team’s success, while Vic focused on protecting Halron, unaware of his involvement in the Pisswater Inn fire. Halron, meanwhile, played to the crowd, showboating to amplify Steorrian support. In the stands, Mo recognised Halron as one of the culprits behind the fire.  but for now, the team’s victory ensured they all advanced to the next round.
