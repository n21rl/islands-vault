The party's journey was interrupted when they spotted a Green Salt Trading Company ship in the distance, seemingly abandoned. Approaching cautiously in a dinghy, they found the surrounding waters infested with sharks. As they fought off the predators, they noticed dead bodies floating in the water.

After dealing with the threat, the party climbed aboard the mysterious vessel. A grim scene awaited them - the entire crew had been brutally slaughtered. Their investigation led them to the captain's cabin, where they discovered a woman's body, stabbed in the back. To their surprise, they recognized her as Abigail Thorpe, who was overseeing the White Clam, one the other two ships from the pirate-hunting expedition that had been launched from Sealtham.

The captain's log revealed crucial information. Another expedition ship had signalled a discovery with a blue flare but before they could reach it, the crew of the White Clam was set upon by a vessel appearing from the fog. The red emergency flare was fired but no help came. The captain had fled and Abigail had stayed with the ship until the end. The party assumed the attacker was Elisabeth Grey.

The return of the party to New Destiny was celebrated. The pirates were thrilled about Calico Jack's freedom and eager to sign the Code that would officially establish the Republic. Wayne approached the party, once more inviting them to join. This led to extensive discussions among the party members and their crew, with Gurt voicing reservations and Kaihakan expressing the desire partake in this big project. Eventually, they decided they would sign the Code if they could add an article to the Code limiting harm to non-combatants.

The party then met with each captain to collect their reward and propose their addition to the Code. During these meetings, they encountered the mystic sea elf captain Luna Mahina. She shared a disturbing tale of her own ship being attacked by a pirate-hunting vessel, resulting in significant casualties among her crew. Luna expressed a strong desire for revenge.

As these events unfolded, New Destiny buzzed with preparations for the upcoming celebrations, excitement was in the air.
