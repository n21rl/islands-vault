The [[Encyclopedia/Groups/Star and Dove Adventurers|group]] kept heading towards their marked destination in hopes of releasing the peryton. He was now too large to fit comfortably in his cage so, at [[Liv]]’s insistence, he was allowed to travel alongside the party members while they kept a close eye on him. Thankfully, he was still bonded to Godfrey and didn’t seem to be trying to attack anyone on the journey.

After a long day’s travel, the party stopped to spend the night in a sheltered area. They decided to watch over each other and the peryton in shifts of two hours intervals. Brennlin took the first watch with no issues. During the second watch, [[Zak]] found himself distracted and didn’t notice the presence of a group of Goliaths watching the party, until one had snuck up behind him and pressed a blade to his throat. Zak tried to explain himself, but it seemed that the warriors didn’t understand any Common. Luckily, he could speak Primordial which they could somewhat understand as they spoke a derived language, Giant. Zak managed to argue the adventurers were “good strangers” and not the “bad strangers” that the Goliaths were cautious of, so they allowed him to wake up his companions. The chief explained they had ended up camping near a [[Goliath tribe]] hiding from Steorrians authorities. When the Jagged Isle was colonised by the [[Steorr|Kingdom of Steorr]], most Goliaths were driven out of their ancestral territory to facilitate green salt mining operations in the mountains. Some Goliaths ended up working in the mines, not always by choice. Brennlin remembered the posters of the Goliath miner in town, with the caption inspiring others to “work hard like Alex!”. Zak related to the Goliaths with his own similar experience spending a year forced by Steorr to mine green salt as punishment for his history of piracy. Zak and the Goliaths shared their common hatred for these “bad strangers” and Zak taught the Goliaths that in Common, these people were called “dicks”.

Zak explained that the group was travelling on a mission to release a “pet”, which a female Goliath thought to be [[Rena]] due to her small size. When the sleeping peryton was revealed to the Goliath, they jumped back in shock at the sight of him. They viewed the “butcherbirds” as a good natural defence to keep strangers at bay in the wild, but thought the group was crazy for keeping one as a pet, however tame it seemed. The chief confirmed the party was headed in the right direction for releasing him.

Trying to relate with potential magic users, Zak showed off some of his skills, casting a flog cloud from his hands for a few seconds. The chief was impressed by this display of “weather power” and promised Zak he could meet the village shaman in the morning.

Satisfied that the adventurers were not of any danger to his tribe, the chief offered to take them to the Goliath settlement for the evening and let them rest there on the condition that the peryton waited outside. They had expanded and maintained a network of caves in the side of the mountain where their small community lived in relative peace.

In the morning, the party made its way over to the shaman with the village chief. The shaman, an older Goliath woman, welcomed them into her cavern room and asked what “powers” they could demonstrate. Zak again showed off his fog cloud, while Rena created marvellous illusions that pleased the chief. He brought in a group of children to see the magic for themselves. Enamoured with Rena’s magic, the Goliath children all crowded around her in amazement. To help add to Rena’s show, Brennlin cast Faerie Fire on top of everyone, raining glitter on them all. Before leaving, [[Gurt]] created a small wooden duck for the kids to play with and imbued it with the power to quack. The kids all fought over the toy, before the chief intervened and instructed his son to share. The shaman asked Zak to create a fog cloud over a nearby river and in return she blessed the party with an aura of stealth to avoid danger (Pass Without Trace). Before they left the camp, the chief pointed them which direction to go and told them they would pass the cabin of a nearby hunter, who was also a “good stranger”.

During the journey, the party started worrying that the peryton would not be able to fend for himself in the wild. Gurt had the bright idea to have Godfrey teach the peryton to hunt from a pack of goats that the party spotted nearby. Thanks to the shaman’s blessing, both of them were able to make their ambush with no issue, with the peryton following Godfrey’s lead. He was able to feed himself a delicious serving of freshly plucked goat heart, and the party continued on with the now satiated peryton, not having to worry if they would be his next meal for a while.

The party found a hidden narrow path just off the main track that the Goliaths told them of. Deciding to lead the way, Brennlin took about ten steps forward before firmly placing his foot onto an unseen beartrap. After struggling to remove it, he was eventually able to free himself thanks to the help of Zak and Gurt. After damaging both his foot and his ego, Brennlin decided against going first, and Gurt let Godfrey take the lead. Godfrey found two more traps before the party spotted the hunter’s cabin, but also his body. The old man had his ribcage torn open and his heart ripped out, most likely by an adult peryton. The sight interested the young peryton, but thankfully he was still full from his goat brunch. Zak offered the now-deceased hunter’s bow to Liv so she had a weapon to take care of herself. Brennlin stashed the supply of dried meats that hanged in the cabin. Noticing the meat had been cured with green salt, he investigated the house to find a amount out of which Gurt made a Minor Healing Potion.

After a while of struggling to dig the man a grave in the coarse, mountainous dirt, the party eventually managed to bury the man in the woods near his home - not too far off where he was killed. Liv found herself disturbed after seeing such a bloodied corpse. She asked if the members of the party followed any god and wanted to say a prayer. No one stepped forward, so she uttered a few words and hoped the hunter was in a better place.

The location marked on the map only a day away, the party decided they would be safe to just release the peryton there, as the monsters’ presence was obvious from the hunter’s violent death. During another hunting session, Gurt had Godfrey attempt to sneak away from the peryton’s side, but the peryton grew frantic noticing Godfrey had left his side and ran after him. Gurt then had Godfrey feint an attack at the peryton, pecking at him angrily. The peryton tried cuddling up to Godfrey and purring, only to find himself attacked by Godfrey again. The startled peryton flapped his wings in defence. Zak magically manifested a peryton cry in the distance, which drew the young monsters attention. As Godfrey went for a third peck, the peryton flew off.

The party then travelled back the way they came with no issues or disruptions, subsisting off the hunter’s collection of cured meats. They stopped in to visit the Goliath camp and inform them of the passing of the hunter, and of the successful release of the young peryton.

On their way back to Sealtham, the party decided to investigate the cave they passed by a few days before. The large crack in the side of the mountain lead to a dark drop about sixty feet down. Gurt picked up a pebble, imbued with light, and threw it down the crack. They could spot what seemed to be the beginning of a passageway at the bottom of the drop, and they could see spider webs lining the walls on the drop down. After inspecting the stonework, Gurt noted that while the crack was mostly a natural formation, there seemed to be evidence of it having been widened by tools.

The party tied ropes to climb down the crack. After travelling down the previously spotted corridor, they came across a strange old man named Parker. His mind halfway broken, he asked the party to search for his missing “puppy”. He told them there were two other cave rooms, the bathroom and the playroom. When asked why he didn’t investigate himself, he said he was scared of the loud noises coming from the playroom.

The party started off investigating the “bathroom” which was a mostly empty cave room with a small pool of running water, formed from water escaping from the ceiling and collecting below. At the bottom of the pool was a small opening in which the water was escaping as quickly as it was gathering. It seemed like the opening could be squeezed through, but the party decided to investigate “the playroom” first.

The party walked into the playroom quietly. Lying flat on the floor was the skeleton of a humanoid figure, with a fallen stalactite impaled through its shattered ribcage. The party also noticed a shape struggling in a giant web, with a massive spider approaching from behind a stalactite on the ceiling.

Springing into action, the party surprised the spider, with Brennlin shooting it. The loud boom of the pistol echoed through the cave and knocked a few stalactites down onto the party, dealing serious damage to Rena and Zak.

After a few attacks focused on the spider, Rena freed the trapped creature with her blade, but it turned out it was actually a sort of large mosquito abomination, and not the supposed dog the party had been searching for. Liv attempted to speak to the two animals to see if either of them might have been Parker’s “puppy”. The buzzing insect called for friends to help it, and the spider simply responded “Woof!” in an enthusiastic manner. Realising they had been targeting the wrong creature, Liv told her companions to change focus to the mosquito, which Brennlin quickly stabbed dead with a dagger next.

Ending combat, Liv apologised to the spider on the party’s behalf. They fed it a potion to heal it’s wounds. The spider told them that Parker was his friend, and he referred to himself as Puppy as that was what he was used to being called by the old man. When asked what he was doing out here, Puppy said he went looking for food and that he wasn’t aware Parker was looking for him. Zak and Rena still quite hurt, the party decided to rest for an hour, chilling in the playroom with Puppy. During this break, they noticed at the end of the room was a small crawlspace in which crackling sounds could be heard. Deciding to investigate, they ventured in the tunnel. Rena had no issue ducking through due to her small stature, whilst everyone else had to crawl and avoid sharp crystals. Zak and Kaihakan made it through unharmed whilst Gurt and Brennlin managed to rack up a few scrapes as they went.

As the crawlspace opened up, the party found themselves in a small cave with green crystals adorning the walls, as well as two crushed humanoid skeletons equipped with mining helmets and pickaxes. Zak recognised most of the crystals as the beginning stages of green salt from his time mining, and noted that they would need at least a few weeks, if not months, before they were ready to harvest. At the end of the room was a large deposit of mature and shiny green salt. Crackling to life, it detached itself from the wall, taking the shape of a large bipedal figure, looking ready to fight.
