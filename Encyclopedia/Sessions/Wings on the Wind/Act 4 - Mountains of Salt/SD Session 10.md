The adventurers spent the first few hours in [[Sealtham]] trying to make deals. It was a very industrial and drab city where the only decorations were posters inviting workers to emulate the productivity of Alex, a Goliath miner. While trying to find a buyer for their shroomwood, the party met a merchant who was quite insistent to learn the provenance of the high-quality material. Thinking humour might help, Brenlinn showed him his laughing dried fish head, a magical trinket he got from the hag’s lair. The man immediately called guards and an altercation ensued. Noticing the argument, Zak, a young white-haired half-elf approached and was able to diffuse the situation as he knew the guards. Up until recently, he had been working in the main mine outside of town, as a sentence for piracy. Taking an interest in the adventurers who seemed to be hiding magic abilities just like him, he offered his services to the team, boasting of his experience in the area. The adventurers were able to sell their shroomwood to a young fisherwoman who wanted to build her own boat. 

That night, they were ready to leave for the peryton territory marked on the hag's map. Rena took charge of the cage, flying above town in the magical rowboat obtained from the hag’s lair. Zak had shrouded it in a cloud of fog in order to hide it. Rena had a near collision with a flying flock of geese but made it through. The rest of the group walked up the path into the mountains. They passed the entrance of the main mine, where they convinced the guards that they were simple travellers.

The party reunited further up the trail and started the hike up the mountain. It was a multi-day tiring journey, especially since they couldn't always find shelter from torrential showers. In a hurry to reach their destination before the peryton reached maturity and his full killing power, the decided against investigating a large crack in the rock. The monster had been rapidly growing in his cage and his eating habits had evolved. He soon rejected the ground up meat rations Godfrey had been feeding him. The group went hunting after a mountain goat they noticed in the distance. They had to pass a rickety rope bridge that swayed and threatened to crack. Once the goat was dead, a pack of hungry wolves approached, attracted by the kill. The adventurers had to fight the wolves but were able to feed the peryton fresh meat.
