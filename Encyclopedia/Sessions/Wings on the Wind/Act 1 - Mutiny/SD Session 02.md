The party found themselves beached on a [[Fort Island|small unmapped island]], most likely somewhere in the [[Northern Scattered Isles]]. They were confronted by [[Hugh Bowes|Bowes]] and his escort composed of [[Elysia]] and [[Steorrian army|Steorrian soldiers]], who had taken [[Bob]] hostage. Bowes ordered the party to recover a crate stolen by [[Orguk]]'s crew, who had been hiding in a ruined fort. The party was to also take control of the ship stationed within the fort's walls. 

After infiltrating the fort through a sea cave, the party made their way up, fighting undead [[Steorrian army|Steorrian soldiers]] on the way. They freed an old [[Mer Woman]] who apparently had been captured years ago. 

There was no sign of Orguk, but the party came across with the four crew members who had made it to the island: [[Cook]] the Goliath, [[Geera]] the half-orc, [[Muni]] the dwarf, [[Kawrl]] the crow-person. They decided to side with them. From the metal crate the crew had stolen, hidden under a layer of green salt, [[Yazim|Brenlinn]] found a magical cloak.
