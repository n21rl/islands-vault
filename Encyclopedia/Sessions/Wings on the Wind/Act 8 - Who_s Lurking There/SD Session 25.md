# Rewrite
The party spent their final days in Áine tying up loose ends and planning their departure. They purchased goods to resell in the Republic, including spirits, spices, maps, and navigation instruments. While Yazim awaited news about his family, the group took on various jobs to earn extra money. Yazim helped organize a festival for Star Week, Kai worked security at the harbour and learned about the details of the exit process for ships, and Gurt repaired glass platforms in the Overcity, as a strike had left them short-handed.

As the Board finally admitted to the prison escape, questioning by guards became more open. On the third day, a disguised Gurt was brought to a guard station. However, he was questioned not about the prison break, but about his knowledge of the Vintage, suggesting the Wessons were after him.

The party decided to leave the next day. On their way to the harbour on the early morning, they were attacked by an assassin. Gurt fled towards the harbour while Yazim and Kai attempted to eliminate the threat. Yazim was repeatedly poisoned by the killer's blades, but the two friends managed to kill the assassin.

They reunited at the harbour and submitted their manifest, not listing Gurt. As they waited on the ship for inspection, Gurt dove into the water with Jack and Esmith in the bag of holding. The inspector seemed to say everything was in order but warned them of an ethereal magical signature in the air. Gurt swam adeptly, despite poor visibility, recognizing currents, identifying the magical gates, and avoiding them before resurfacing far from the harbour, moments before the bag ran out of air. He then met back up with the ship.

During the voyage, Kai talked to Moku and learned that his parents were human merchants sacrificed by the Hakari, and that Kahwra had taken him in despite Moku's objections. Moku had retreated from the tribe, only visiting infrequently. On his last visit, he saw Tanawhu destroy the villages, gathering that it was because the Hakari had betrayed their purity.

Gurt fixed the android head, revealing it as the Guild's Potent Thinker, designed as a repository of knowledge but faulty. Fish seemed to make a large proportion of the crew sick, though the party found it was healthy. They suspected the newcomers Moku, Tuatahi, and Tuarua but couldn't prove it.

To comfort the crew, Yazim opened a cask of rum, leading to rowdy celebrations. During the night, Kai heard a splash and noticed Bob was overboard. He jumped down to rescue him. Back on deck, they noticed a bump on Bob's head, but he couldn't remember due to being drunk. The party investigated and found that a club held by a strong hand might have been used to knock Bob overboard. They questioned the crew but were unable to narrow down the culprit.

The next day, they noticed the ropes holding the sails were frayed. They quickly fixed them but set up a fake accident with Yazim pretending to fall due to a damaged rope, while Gurt and Kai watched the crew intently. They decided to interrogate the cook, who didn't seem to react.

In the captain's cabin, while questioning the cook, a high-pitched voice cursed them from the cook's mouth. It came from a sea louse attached to the cook's tongue. The cook crumbled to the ground, and the louse vanished, but Gurt deployed one of his gadgets to track it. Kaihakan and Gurt rushed out in pursuit while Yazim stayed to take care of Cook. Yazim healed him and used a spell to communicate psychically, allowing Cook to reveal that something strange had happened to him after the visit to the floating wreck of the Arrow, and he had been "losing moments of time."

The louse climbed the mast in the ethereal plane, likely attempting to possess Kawrl. The party warned Kawrl to glide down, and Kai climbed the mast with a rope attached by Gurt. In the crow's nest, the louse attempted to attach to Kai's tongue, but Gurt pulled the rope, causing Kai and the louse to fall, severely injuring Kai. Yazim rushed to help, magically commanding the louse to stop moving, allowing the party to stab it to death.

With the threat neutralized, they continued their travel towards New Destiny.
