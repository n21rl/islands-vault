The Church of the Unwavering Star holds an official and deeply entrenched opposition to the practice of magic. This stance is a core tenet of their faith, shaping both their theology and their influence on the laws and culture of the Kingdom of Steorr.
Official Doctrine
According to the Church, magic is a profane force and an affront to the divine order established by their one true god, the Unwavering Star. Their teachings assert that the Star grants strength to the faithful not through "unnatural means" like sorcery, but through faith, discipline, and clarity of purpose. This belief is so fundamental that the use of magic is considered an aggravating circumstance for other perceived offenses within Steorrian society.
Distinction from Miracles
The Church draws a firm line between what it defines as profane magic and the divine miracles performed by the early Saints. The deeds of figures like Saint Astron and Saint Dorian are not considered sorcery. Instead, they are framed as unique, divinely willed events—proof that faith alone is a sufficient force to change the world. The Church teaches that the "Age of Saints has passed," effectively closing the possibility for any modern supernatural acts to be considered miracles. Any such display today is, by definition, heresy.
Historical Context and Enforcement
The Church's anti-magic stance evolved alongside its political power. Over time, theology began to serve state ideology, and a strict condemnation of magic became a tool for maintaining order and control. Acknowledging modern miracles or devout magic-users would create new centers of power and challenge the Church's centralized authority.
The Church's influence is significant, and its clergy often shapes policy. While not always outright illegal, the practice of magic is heavily persecuted, and its users are often blamed for various evils. This has led to tensions, particularly in the Islands where magic is more common among the native inhabitants.
Social Implications
Within Steorrian society, individuals who can wield magic are viewed with fear and distrust. This deep-seated cultural bias is a direct result of the Church's teachings. Those with magical abilities face social alienation and are often associated with corrupting influences that threaten the purity of Steorrian identity.
