The Big Beasts are ancient, primordial entities woven into the myths and beliefs of the Clawed Clans. Unlike conventional gods, the Big Beasts are not worshipped as omnipotent deities but are seen as colossal, near-mythic beings whose echoes still shape the world. Each of these Beasts represents an elemental force, a guiding principle, or a fundamental truth of nature. The Big Beasts are not simply gods but fundamental forces interwoven into the history, land, and identity of the Clawed Clans. Their influence shapes war, politics, survival, and philosophical outlooks, ensuring that even in their silence, they still speak to those who listen.

The exact nature of the Big Beasts is a subject of much debate among scholars, Bone-Speakers, and mystics. Some believe they are remnants of a time before mortals, beings who once walked the earth, sky, and sea, shaping the land through their movements. They see them as ancestral figures who gave rise the the various beastfolks, guiding the living through echoes of the past. Others treat them as embodiment of the land's feature and forces of nature, entities that must be understood and respected rather than worshipped. 

The Bone-Speakers act as interpreters of the Big Beasts’ will, reading omens and natural signs to decipher their influence on the world.

## The Major Big Beasts
Each Big Beast is associated with a particular aspect of nature, philosophical concept, or clan. Their influence is often interpreted through omens, natural phenomena, and ancestral memories.

### The Whispering Whale

Like the slow movement of the Whale, wisdom is believed to unfold over time—those who rush to act without understanding are said to be deaf to its song. Shamans and scholars meditate, believing that true understanding comes from listening rather than speaking. The Whale is also tied to oral tradition—its followers believe that knowledge is not meant to be hoarded but passed down like rolling tides, ensuring that nothing is truly lost.
It is sometimes conflated with [[Savisi'lo]].

## Beliefs and practices
- When a person dies, their spirit travels back to their patron Beast, who either accepts them into their domain or sends them back as a spirit, an omen or guide.
- The spirits of the dead are never truly gone; they remain present in the land, natural phenomena, the animals, and the voices of their descendants. 
- Many Clawed Clans keep ancestral relics—a claw, a feather, a carved stone—to carry their forebears' presence with them.
- Before major battles, warriors call on their ancestors, invoking them to stand beside them in the fight.
- Though customs vary, funerals generally focus on guiding the spirit to its rightful place and ensuring it does not become lost. The body is returned to an element: sky, river or sea, soil, lava.
