Savisi'lo (sometimes called Tangaroa) is a whale deity worshipped by the sea elves of the Islands, guardian of the underworld. It is said that when a sea elf dies or is dying, they should be brought to a sacred coral reef called Pupaia. Pupaia is submerged in an underwater lake that the sea elves cannot survive in. The dead are sunk into Pupaia where the sea elves believe that Savisi'lo finds them and brings them to the peace in the underworld. For this reason whales are regarded with utmost reverence in sea elf culture.

Savisi'lo is said to have a nemesis named [[Tanawhu]], an evil squid deity bent on subverting the death rituals of the sea elves and taking their souls for itself. Tanawhu feasts on the souls of the dead and grows ever larger. It is from Tanawhu that all other Taniwha or sea monsters are born. Savisi'lo did battle with Tanawhu and with the help of all the gods of the sea elves managed to seal the squid Tanawhu in a haunted deep sea trench known as the Kitiri Trench. Defeated but not slain, Tanawhu plots its escape, spawning forth the Taniwha from the Kitiri Trench to carry out its vile will.

Savisi'lo is sometimes equated to the [[Big Beasts#The Whispering Whale|Whispering Whale Big Beast]].
