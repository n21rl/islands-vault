### **Selvean Funeral Rites: Honoring Life, Death, and the Cosmic Balance**

In Selvean culture, death is not an end but a **transformation**, a necessary cycle of renewal in harmony with the cosmos. The funeral rites reflect the **Selvean view of duality**, emphasizing the connection between the body, spirit, and the divine forces that govern existence.

## **1. The Philosophy of Death in Selvea**

- **Death is a Transition**: The Selveans believe that life and death are not opposing forces but interconnected states. The deceased do not "leave" but are **woven into the fabric of existence**, influencing the living through their lingering essence.
- **Blood as a Sacred Offering**: Since Selveans practice **ritual bloodletting** to honor the gods, funerary rites involve **a final offering of the deceased’s blood**, symbolizing their return to the divine cycle.
- **Stars and the Earth**: The body belongs to the **earth**, the soul to the **stars**, and the spirit lingers in the **rivers and winds**—a sacred trinity of transformation.

## **2. The Selvean Funeral Process**

### **A. The Three-Day Vigil** (Preparation of the Body)

- **Ritual Cleansing**: The body is washed with sacred oils infused with jungle herbs, marking the transition from life to death.
- **Adornment**: The deceased is dressed in **ceremonial robes**, woven with lunar and solar patterns to symbolize their journey through the cosmic cycle.
- **Final Blood Offering**: A ceremonial cut is made on the palm or chest, and the blood is collected into a sacred vessel to be used in the funeral rites.

During this time, family and community members gather to **share memories, chant songs of passage, and meditate on the deceased’s contributions** to the world.


### **B. The Three Paths of Burial** (Methods of the Final Rest)

Selveans practice three main burial rites, chosen based on the deceased's life path, family tradition, and social status.

#### **1. The Sky Rite (For Nobles, Priests, and Mystics)**

- The body is **placed atop a temple pyramid**, exposed to the open sky for **celestial vultures** to consume.
- This is called the **"Returning to the Stars"**, a sacred practice ensuring the soul ascends fully into the cosmic realm.
- After the flesh is gone, the bones are **painted in blue and silver** and stored in **family ossuaries**.

🔹 **Symbolism**: This method honors the belief that **priests and rulers must rise above the mortal plane** to become celestial guides.



#### **2. The River Rite (For Warriors, Explorers, and Travelers)**

- The body is wrapped in **reed mats** and placed on a wooden raft.
- The raft is **set aflame and released down the river**, symbolizing the **flow of life into the afterlife**.
- If the body **sinks before it burns completely**, it is seen as a sign that the deceased will **reincarnate into a great warrior**.

🔹 **Symbolism**: This represents the spirit’s **return to the waters**, where life flows eternally between the mortal and divine realms.



#### **3. The Earth Rite (For Farmers, Artisans, and Common Folk)**

- The body is **buried in the jungle**, but instead of a simple grave, it is **planted beneath a sapling**, often a fruit-bearing tree.
- The tree is believed to **absorb the essence** of the deceased, **feeding their spirit into the land**.
- Families visit the tree on **holy days**, offering **food, prayers, and small blood sacrifices** at its roots.

🔹 **Symbolism**: This method emphasizes **renewal and legacy**, allowing the deceased to **sustain future generations** through nature.


### **C. The Night of Reflection (Final Mourning Rituals)**

- **At midnight after the burial**, loved ones gather at temples or sacred sites.
- A **small amount of the deceased’s blood** (collected from the initial offering) is **mixed with ritual ink** and used to write the name of the deceased on temple walls, family homes, or personal belongings.
- **Silent meditation** is observed for an hour, during which mourners reflect on what wisdom or guidance the deceased may offer from the afterlife.



## **3. Funerary Artifacts and Traditions**

### **A. Spirit Masks**

- The deceased’s **death mask** is crafted by artisans, depicting their **idealized form** in silver or obsidian.
- These masks are **kept in family shrines** or buried with the body to guide the spirit in the afterlife.


### **B. The Role of the Bloodkeepers (Funerary Priests)**

- The **Bloodkeepers** are **Selvean priests** tasked with **performing funeral rites** and preserving **ancestral knowledge**.
- They **record a person’s final words**, which are often **inscribed onto their burial site**.
- They **interpret omens** from the **way the body decays** or how the elements interact with it.

### **C. The Annual Remembrance Ceremony**

- Each year, families return to burial sites to **speak to the spirits of the dead**, making **offerings of blood, fruit, and sacred incense**.
- It is believed that on this night, **the spirits whisper back**, offering guidance, warnings, or blessings

### **4. Forbidden Deaths and Their Curses**

Selveans believe that **not all deaths are equal**, and some fates disrupt the cosmic cycle:

#### **1. The Unburied**

- Those who die without funeral rites are **cursed to wander the mortal world**, unable to rejoin the cosmic balance.
- Their spirits manifest as **whispers in the wind**, **haunting dreams**, or **shadows moving in torchlight**.

#### **2. The Oathbreaker’s Grave**

- Those who **betrayed their people, defied the gods, or committed sacrilege** are denied **all three paths of burial**.
- Their bodies are left in **abandoned places**, where they are **erased from history**.
- It is said that **the jungle reclaims them**, and their souls **dissolve into the earth, never to be reborn**.



### **Conclusion: Death as an Eternal Cycle**

Selvean funeral rites reflect **their view of the cosmos**—that life and death are interconnected forces, bound by ritual and belief. Whether returning to the **stars, the waters, or the earth**, every death is a **continuation of existence**, a step in the eternal dance of balance.

Selvean Funeral Rites with Blood Draining

Given Selvean beliefs in cosmic balance, sacrifice, and the cycle of life and death, incorporating blood draining into their funeral rituals aligns well with their philosophy. Here’s how it could be integrated:

The Final Offering: Draining the Life Essence

Before a body is committed to its final resting place, the blood must be ritually drained and returned to the land, water, or gods:

Symbolic Meaning: Blood is seen as a sacred force, carrying the spirit’s vitality. Removing it allows the deceased to fully transition from the mortal world to the divine realm.

Ritual Process:

The body is placed on a stone altar in a temple or a family’s sacred grounds.

A priest or family elder uses a ceremonial obsidian blade to open the veins at the wrists, throat, or heart.

The blood is collected in sacred vessels and then distributed in different ways:

For the Sky Rite (Celestial Burials): The blood is painted onto the bones after the vultures have stripped the flesh, marking the body’s final ascension.

For the River Rite (Water Burials): The blood is poured into the river, symbolizing the deceased’s return to the eternal currents of life.

For the Earth Rite (Burial Under Trees): The blood is mixed into the soil at the base of the burial tree, nourishing the next cycle of life.



Final Words & Incantations: As the blood is drained, the priest or loved ones chant prayers of release and remembrance, asking the ancestors and gods to guide the spirit safely beyond.
