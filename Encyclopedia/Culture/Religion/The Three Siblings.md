Áine and her younger brothers Ben and Cad, often referred to as the Three Siblings supposedly discovered the [[Siblín Islands]]. It is said that Cad harvested materials, Ben crafted items, and Áine sold finished products. 

Some people in the [[Siblín Guilds]] view the them as deities, especially associated with their mythical trade. For example, a blacksmith living in Áine might worship Ben for his association with crafting, rather than Áine because she is the patron of the city-island. People believing in one of the siblings as a god most likely believe in the others as such, but they may have a favourite.

This religion does not have a central power and each guild and person worships differently.

 roadside shrines to Cad for safe journeys, or blacksmith offerings to Ben for fortune.
