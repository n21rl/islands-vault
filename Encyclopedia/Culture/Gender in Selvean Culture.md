Selvean society as a whole has a structured but flexible set of gender roles. These roles reflect cosmic dualities while granting each gender a specific space of influence. While Selvean society has clearly defined roles, there is room for exceptions. This structure preserves distinct gendered associations while allowing for flexibility in exceptional cases. Non-binary individuals are known as Children of the Gloam. They often hold a unique position of reverence, making them special and integral to Selvean culture.

They often occupy positions of mediation, strategic leadership, and spiritual oversight.

Impact of Gender Roles on Society

Harmony in Diversity: By reserving specific spheres of influence for each gender, Selvean society achieves balance. Each role is seen as indispensable, with no gender inherently superior.

Non-Binary Reverence: Non-binary people are central to maintaining harmony, acting as mediators and spiritual exemplars. Their roles are not merely symbolic but practical, ensuring societal cohesion.

Flexibility and Respect: Though roles are defined, individual talents and divine guidance are given precedence, allowing for exceptions that enrich the culture.





This structure creates a gendered framework that feels distinct and harmonious, with non-binary individuals occupying a special, sacred position while men and women maintain dominant roles in their respective spheres. It emphasises balance and interconnectedness, central to Selvean beliefs.


In Selvean society, non-binary individuals are highly regarded and hold a sacred place within both the spiritual and political realms. Their gender identity is not only accepted but celebrated as an embodiment of cosmic balance, representing the integration of opposites—male and female, creation and destruction, life and death. This perspective is deeply woven into the fabric of Selvean beliefs and practices.

Selveans believe that balance is the cornerstone of the universe. The concept of gender is seen as fluid, more like a spectrum than a rigid binary. Non-binary individuals embody this fluidity and are thought to have special insights into the forces of nature and the cosmos that others do not.

Roles and Positions:

1. Spiritual Leadership:

Non-binary people are often spiritual leaders or shamans, seen as divine intermediaries between the physical and metaphysical realms. This role comes with significant responsibility, as non-binary individuals are thought to possess the ability to commune with both the masculine and feminine forces of the world.

Non-binary spiritual figures may officiate over important ceremonies, including sacred rites, harvest festivals, and rituals to honor the gods or seek guidance in times of crisis. In this way, their identity is inseparable from their spiritual authority.

They may also be seen as mediators between different factions (e.g., Selveans and Steorrians) or healers, using their wisdom to balance tensions within communities and offer solutions that others may overlook.



2. Political Influence:
Non-binary individuals occupy various important positions throughout Selvean society. These roles may include advisors, diplomats, and even military commanders, with their identities viewed as a symbol of the harmonization of differing forces.

Their ability to navigate multiple perspectives makes them valuable political figures, particularly in a society where tensions between the Selveans, Steorrians, and other factions are common.

Non-binary people are thought to embody unity, being naturally adept at negotiating and resolving disputes between conflicting parties.



1. Cultural Custodians:

In the Selvean worldview, non-binary individuals are often custodians of tradition, maintaining the knowledge of rituals, myths, and sacred texts that reflect the union of the masculine and feminine forces. These individuals are considered the guardians of cultural identity and the preservers of ancient knowledge that connects the people to their gods and the cosmic balance.

Some non-binary people may be lorekeepers or historians, responsible for passing down oral traditions that emphasize the importance of harmony between all aspects of life, from the gods to the natural world.







Social Status and Relationships:

2. High Status:

Non-binary people in Selvea are treated with deep respect, particularly because of their role in symbolizing the balance between opposites. They are often elevated to high status, with their presence being considered a blessing from the gods.

Unlike in many cultures where non-binary identities may be marginalized or misunderstood, Selveans see them as highly valuable individuals—not only for their spiritual and political contributions but for their representation of the cosmic forces that govern the world.



3. Inclusion in Family Structures:

While traditional gender roles do exist in Selvean society, non-binary individuals play a significant role within families, particularly when it comes to mentorship and guidance. They might be seen as the family’s spiritual anchor, offering wisdom and advice not only in governance but in personal matters as well.

Some non-binary individuals may adopt children or serve as parents, with their unique ability to navigate multiple perspectives making them valued mentors. Their identity allows them to bridge the gap between masculine and feminine energies, helping children grow with a deeper understanding of the world’s fluidity.



4. Cultural Rituals and Festivals:

During certain ceremonial gatherings and festivals, non-binary people take on prominent roles, with specific dances, prayers, and blessings performed in their honour. These rituals are meant to honour their unique connection to the forces of balance, celebrating their ability to embody both halves of the cosmic equation.

Festivals might include rites where non-binary individuals are chosen to represent both male and female aspects of a divine being (for example, the combination of a male god and female goddess into a singular being), symbolizing the divine union that the Selveans seek to emulate.







Symbolism and Representation:

5. Sacred Objects and Symbols:

Non-binary individuals are often associated with specific sacred symbols in Selvean culture. These symbols could be dualistic in nature, such as intertwined serpent and eagle motifs (representing two forces working together) or a balance of dark and light energy.

They might wear ornate jewelry or headdresses with symbols of duality, such as intertwined crescent moons or twin suns, to emphasize their role as the merging of two worlds.



6. Sacred Garments:

The clothing of non-binary individuals often incorporates aesthetic elements from both male and female traditions. These garments might combine robes with sharp, angular designs (traditionally masculine) and flowing fabrics (traditionally feminine). These symbolic clothes are meant to represent their ability to transcend traditional boundaries.

Colour symbolism is crucial, with non-binary people often dressing in blended colours like indigo (mixing blue and purple) or a combination of gold and silver, representing the fusion of masculine and feminine energies.







Community and Society:

7. Education and Mentorship:

Non-binary individuals in Selvea may serve as teachers, particularly in matters of spirituality, philosophy, and cultural heritage. They could be seen as the custodians of balanced wisdom, sharing knowledge that bridges the gap between different philosophies, whether between Selvean and Steorrian beliefs or between the natural and supernatural worlds.

Their role in education may also extend to advising rulers, helping guide the decisions of kings, chieftains, or high-ranking officials with a perspective that ensures balance and unity are maintained.



8. Cultural Change and Fluidity:

Non-binary people are seen as catalysts for cultural change, representing the inherent fluidity of identity and the changing nature of the universe. They may be involved in activism or cultural reforms, pushing for greater acceptance of a wide spectrum of identities, and encouraging others to question rigid norms that limit personal expression.







Potential Role in Your Campaign:

In your campaign, non-binary Selveans could be key figures within the story—both in leadership and in more personal, community-driven roles. The presence of non-binary people would suggest a society where fluidity and balance are highly valued, and such figures could serve as:

Guides for the PCs, offering spiritual wisdom and practical advice on maintaining balance in the face of conflict.

Mediators between factions, helping to broker peace or understanding between groups like the Steorrians and the Selveans.

Symbols of hope and unity, inspiring characters who are struggling with their own identity or who come from cultures that don’t understand or accept fluid gender expression.


By treating non-binary individuals with reverence and respect, Selvean society would be a powerful example of a culture where diversity and harmony are at the heart of both spiritual beliefs and everyday life.
