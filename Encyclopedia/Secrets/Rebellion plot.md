Nobles conspirators part of the [[Rebellion]] are using their influence within the [[Green Salt Trading Company]], a powerful organisation in charge of mining and selling green salt on behalf of Steorr. They are secretly gathering large number of individually low-value magic items from around the Islands, including the [[Northern Scattered Isles]]. They are then shipping them through intermediaries  like Hugh Bowes to the country of the Siblín Guilds, where they have a secret deal with the [[Wesson family]]. The Wessons have have people in their employ who can extract and combine magical energy from these to create a highly destructive liquid they refer to as the [[Vintage]]. This is highly illegal and kept hidden from the Siblín authorities. The rebellious nobles plan to use this dangerous weapon in their fight against Steorr.

## Discoveries by the party and allies
The party do not know the details of the rebellion plot describe above. They have however discovered several clues related to it.

At the beginning of the campaign, [[Orguk]], who was the captain of the party's crew, staged a mutiny against the Arrow's owner, the merchant Hugh Bowes. During the mutiny, magic items were discovered hidden in crates in the hold of the ship. The ship was attacked by a sea monster and Orguk was separated from the party. Beached on a small island, the party sided against Hugh Bowes and left him stranded. Meanwhile, Orguk met with pirates of [[Republic]]. To get into their good graces, he revealed to them that magic items were being secretly transported to the Siblíns. 

Based on Pirates from the Republic started targeting ships from Steorr and the Green Salt Trading Company specifically, in order to plunder magic items. Meanwhile, Bowes made his way back to Sealtham and gathered that Orguk and allies must be linked to the pirates' recent actions. The party overheard a conversation between Bowes and Brummbär referencing these recent events. In response to the attacks, Lord Mayor Brummbär ordered a pirate-hunting expedition to neutralise the threat, retrieve the items and prevent information about the Rebellion from leaking. The party and their ship were requisitioned for this expedition, but ended up siding with the pirates.

Returning to the floating wreck of the Arrow to collect remaining magic items, the party discovered two documents. One was a [[letter to Mr B.]], presumably Bowes, alluding to his task and the future of the Islands. The other was a [[Siblín Guilds entry document]] for Bowes' ship and crew, citing [[Orla Wesson]], head of the [[Transporters Guild]], as vouching contact.

Orguk, the pirates and the party do not know the true purpose of the magic items yet. To summarise, the party knows the following information:
- During the mutiny, the party discovered various magic items on Hugh Bowes' ship, which are prohibited by Steorr
- Subsequent pirate attacks on Steorrian ships revealed they also carried magic items, hinting at a widespread enterprise
- In Sealtham, the witnessed Hugh Bowes meeting with Lord Mayor Brummbär, implicating the mayor in the operation
- Documents found on the ship's wreck revealed Bowes was connected to powerful people and Orla Wesson
- Erin Wesson's ledger
