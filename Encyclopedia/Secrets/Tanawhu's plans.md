Tanawhu is a powerful entity trapped in the [[Kitiri Trench]] who aims to free himself by gathering magic in any form
## Attack of the Hakari Isles
The Hakari, despite their fervour, failed to gather enough sacrifice for Tanawhu. Tanawhu changed tactics and rather than using the Hakari on the surface, he sent monsters to drag them to the bottom of the sea to harness their souls. Additionally, this made a martyr out of Kaihakan would could be used to further his power.
## Attack of the Arrow
The merchant Hugh Bowes secretly transported prohibited magic items on the Arrow, unknown to Captain Orguk and crew. The magical aura drew the attention of Tanawhu. The god ordered his giant the giant octopus to attack the ship and retrieve the magic treasures to gather power and weaken his bonds. During its assault on the Arrow, the octopus caused massive damage before leaving with some magic items. In the chaos, Orguk grabbed onto a tentacle and was carried along as the octopus returned south to bring treasures to Tanawhu's prison in the Kitiri Trench. The octopus discarded Orguk on the island of Eleuthera. 

Though battered, the Arrow did not fully sink. The parasitic louse Cymothoalix inhabited the wreck, using druidic magic from his enthralled pawn Whelk to summon crustacean monsters. They patched up the ship with barnacles, making it Cymothoalix's new lair.

Later when the party investigated the wreck to retrieve the remaining items, the octopus returned, still drawn by the lingering magic aura. It crushed the ship to get to the treasure at the heart of it. Through the octopus, Tanawhu recognized his champion Kaihakan among the group leaving with the chest of magic items and ordered the beast not to attack the party. 
## Grooming of Kaihakan 
Tanawhu wants [[Kaihakan|Kai]] to train to become a champion and grow the shoal.
