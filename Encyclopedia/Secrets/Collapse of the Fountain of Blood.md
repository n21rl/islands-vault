The Collapse of the Fountain of Blood marks the catastrophic end of [[Old Selvea]]’s age of near-immortality and high magic. When the rulers of [[Selvea]] attempted to deepen the power of the [[Fountain of Blood]] through an unprecedented ritual, the Fountain failed, the reality tear sealed, and magic across the empire fractured. The event triggered waves of rapid ageing, mass death, political collapse, and the later [[Great Burning]], as survivors tried to erase all trace of what had happened. It is also remembered in hidden lore as the moment that gave birth to entities such as [[The Echo of the Fountain]]. 


Elven lifespans stretched across centuries, and magic was widespread among elites, reinforcing Selvea’s dominance over the jungle mesas and their pyramid-cities. See [[Selvea]] and [[Fountain of Blood]].


In this era, the capital’s stepped pyramids crowned the jungle mesas of Selvea, aligned to celestial forces and surrounded by plazas where blood mingled with carved stone and river water. [[Nature of magic]] and [[Reality tears]] provide a broader framework for this metaphysical order.

Precipitating Causes

Centuries into this golden age, signs of imbalance appeared. Accounts preserved in hidden lore speak of:

A growing “hunger” in the Fountain, requiring ever-increasing sacrifice to maintain the same level of power

Suspicions that powers on the far side of the tear were pulling it closed, or that the structure of the tear itself was weakening

Political pressure on the Blood Chorus to preserve elven supremacy and immortality at any cost


In response, the rulers of Old Selvea authorised experimental rites to “renew” or expand the Fountain’s capacity. These rituals involved slaughter on an unprecedented scale, combining prisoners of war, condemned criminals, and exalted volunteers in a single, brutal calculus. The goal was to flood the Fountain with enough blood and soul-stuff to anchor the tear more firmly.

Instead, the system was pushed past its limits.

The Day of Collapse

When the final ritual was enacted at the main Fountain site, accounts describe a sequence of catastrophic phenomena:

The Fountain, overwhelmed by incompatible souls, shuddered and shattered.

The tear in reality collapsed inward “like a wound suddenly clotting”, severing the flow of magic.

Across Selvea, elves far from the Fountain aged in sudden waves; some died outright, others withered into frailty over days.

Spells unraveled or detonated; enchanted structures failed; entire libraries and archives in coastal cities crumbled or turned to strange substances such as salt.


In the jungles around the Fountain, the land itself reacted. Trees warped, vines surged over stone, and the valley housing the ritual complex was rapidly swallowed beneath growth and landslide. Later accounts speak of a phenomenon known as “The Jungle Closed”, where paths, sight-lines, and even landmarks seemed to vanish within a generation.

Some late Old Selvean poems and fragmented testimony also describe pale, half-formed figures glimpsed in the plazas and processional ways on the day the sky reddened—apparitions thought by some scholars to be the distorted remnants of sacrificed souls pulled back toward the collapsing tear. Whether these “pale witnesses” ever truly existed remains disputed.

Possession of the High Priest

A crucial but largely unknown element of the Collapse concerns the final hours of the Fountain chamber itself.

As the ritual failed and the structure of reality tore inward, the High Priest of the Fountain entered the inner chamber in a desperate attempt to stabilise the tear. Within the collapsing rift, something stirred: formless, dreamlike residue from the Feywild or beyond. While the priest enacted his last rites, this entity sensed a route out of oblivion.

It flowed into him.

Their essences merged, transforming the priest into the first known host of the being later called [[The Drowsy One]]. Now a conduit of alien dream-magic, the priest fled or wandered from the ruins as Old Selvea collapsed around him. In the centuries that followed, scattered legends spoke of an immortal wanderer, singing strange lullabies and trailing dreams not entirely his own.

This event links the Collapse of the Fountain to later manifestations of the Drowsy One throughout the Starlit Era and to other Fountain-born entities such as [[Mama Yaya]], who likewise originates from the magical rupture of the Fountain of Blood and anchors herself in memory and dream.

The Great Burning and Erasure

In the political and religious chaos that followed the Collapse, surviving Selvean leaders faced a dual crisis: material devastation and the existential threat posed by knowledge of what they had done.

Their response was the [[Great Burning]].

Records, maps, ritual texts, and artefacts related to the Fountain and its maintenance were systematically destroyed.

The Blood Chorus and their direct descendants were purged or dispersed.

Public narratives recast the Burning as a spiritual purification, rather than a cover-up of catastrophic magical malpractice.


The aim was twofold: to prevent anyone from attempting to restore the Fountain, and to remove any surviving proof of the ruling caste’s responsibility for the disaster. Yet cultural habits lingered. Even after the Fountain’s true function was forgotten, bloodletting remained central to [[Selvean funeral rites]] and other ceremonies, stripped of its original cosmological context but still echoing the old bargain.

Diaspora and the End of Old Selvea

The Collapse shattered Old Selvea’s demographic and political base. As lifespans shortened and magical infrastructure failed, many elves abandoned their ancestral jungle mesas and sailed westward, establishing new communities in the lands that would later be known as the Old Lands.

Consequences included:

A permanent split between the descendants of Old Selvea and the elves of the Old Lands, who preserved only fragmentary, distorted knowledge of their origin.

The reconfiguration of Selvean power from an immortal, Fountain-centred empire to a more conventional, mortal state in later eras. See [[Selvea]] and [[Political History of Steorr]] for comparative timelines.

The quiet disappearance of blood-mathematics as an open discipline; what remained survived only in occult lineages and encoded rituals.


From this point on, elven longevity became exceptional rather than baseline, and mortal lifespans became the new normal for most peoples of the Islands.

Long-Term Magical Consequences

The sealing of the Fountain’s tear altered the magical ecology of the world:

The overall density of ambient magic decreased, especially in regions once directly fed by the Fountain’s ley-bloodlines.

Some enchantments fossilised into static artefacts; others failed catastrophically.

Strange anomalies in the deep jungle and certain ruin sites suggest that pockets of Fountain-charged reality persisted, warped but not fully quenched.


The Collapse also revealed that the Fountain was only one of several [[Reality tears]] shaping the world. Comparisons are often drawn—by those few who know the truth—between the Fountain and the [[Unwavering Star]], or the hidden tear beneath the sea described in [[Nature of magic]].

Modern Myths, Purists, and Dangerous Curiosity

By the present day, reliable knowledge of the Collapse is almost entirely lost outside of secret orders, dream-bound entities, and the rare survivor of ancient pacts. Among public histories, the event is at most a vague “fall of Old Selvea”, with no clear cause.

However, its legacy persists in three main strands:

Steorrian scholars and treasure-hunters whisper of a lost elven method of functional immortality and sponsor expeditions into the jungles of [[Domiselvea]] in search of the ruins of the Fountain.

The [[Elven Purists]] venerate an idealised vision of pre-Collapse elvenkind and seek, in some factions, to reopen the Fountain or recreate its effects, regardless of the risks.

Entities born in or shaped by the Collapse, such as [[The Drowsy One]] and [[Mama Yaya]], continue to influence events from the margins—through dreams, possession, and the manipulation of memory. The [[Tetzilwahi ruins]] and the [[Hollow]] are notable loci of this lingering influence.


Fragments of late Old Selvean verse, dream-accounts, and jungle folklore occasionally surface, hinting at “a valley that drank the years” or “a song that survived its singer”. For most scholars, these are curiosities. For those who know the pattern, they are warnings.
