Before the Collapse, the Fountain of Blood functioned as the primary magical conduit of Old Selvea. Anchored to a tear between the Material Plane and the Feywild, it fed elven longevity and arcane power through ritual sacrifice and carefully maintained blood mathematics.

The Fountain’s influence defined Selvean society:

The rituals of the Fountain were state institutions, overseen by a priest-ruler caste sometimes called the Blood Chorus.

Public sacrifices, Festivals of Life and Loss, and bloodletting ceremonies were common; blood was treated as a patriotic offering.

## Overview
The Fountain of Blood was an ancient magical conduit central to the power and longevity of the elves of [[Old Selvea]]. It acted as an anchor for a tear in reality, a rift that connected the Material Plane to the Feywild. This tear was one of several known breaches where magic from beyond leaked into the world, much like the [[Unwavering Star]] and the hidden abyssal tear beneath the ocean.

Through blood sacrifices, the elves channeled magic through the Fountain, sustaining their long lifespans, immense magical potential, and deep connection to the Feywild. When an attempt to expand the tear’s power failed catastrophically, the Fountain’s magic collapsed, leading to widespread death, rapid aging, and the permanent shortening of elven lifespans. This event triggered the Great Burning, where rulers of [[Selvea]] erased all knowledge of the Fountain to prevent anyone from trying to restore it.

## Function and Purpose

The Fountain of Blood was not a natural spring but a carefully maintained ritual site designed to channel Feywild energy into the Material Plane.

- Blood as the Key – Elves fed their blood into the Fountain, ensuring the tear remained stable and open.
- A Controlled Gateway – The Fountain acted as a focus point, preventing the tear from collapsing or growing unstable.
- Elven Longevity and Power – The sustained flow of energy granted elves their long lifespans and powerful magic, though only the elites fully understood its function.
- A Fragile Balance – The Fountain’s magic had to be carefully maintained, requiring ritual bloodletting at regular intervals.

## The Cataclysm: The Closing of the Tear

At some point, the rulers of Old Selvea attempted to expand the Fountain’s power, either to gain more control over the Feywild, increase their magic, or prolong their lives further. The experiment failed, leading to devastating consequences:

- The Fountain collapsed, and the tear shut.
- Elves lost their long lifespans, rapidly aging and dying in waves.
- Magic became unstable, causing widespread destruction.
- Entire regions of Old Selvea fell into ruin.

In the chaos, many elves fled, abandoning their homeland and sailing across the sea to what would later become known as the Old Lands. This exile created a permanent split between Selvean elves and the elves of the Old Lands, who preserved fragments of knowledge but lost much of their connection to the original source of power.

## The Great Burning: A Cover-Up

In the aftermath, the rulers of Selvea made the drastic decision to erase all records of the Fountain and its rituals. This event, later called the Great Burning, was framed as a cultural purification, but in truth, it was a desperate attempt to hide the catastrophe and prevent future generations from repeating the mistake.

- Records, scrolls, and artifacts related to the Fountain were burned.
- The existence of the Fountain was removed from history.
- The blood rituals that once maintained the tear were altered, becoming religious and symbolic rather than magical.

While the truth was buried, fragments of the old ways survived, passed down through oral traditions, secretive sects, and hidden ruins.

## Echoes in Modern Culture

Though the Fountain is gone, traces of its influence remain in Selvean culture, particularly in bloodletting rituals and funerary rites:

- Voluntary Bloodletting – Many Selvean elites still practice self-inflicted blood sacrifice, believing it purifies the soul or strengthens their connection to history. The ritual has lost its original magical function but remains a respected tradition. [[Selvean funeral rites]]
- Funerary Blood Rituals – The draining of blood from the deceased may be a remnant of ancient rites once tied to sustaining the Fountain.
- Myths of a Lost Fountain – Some faint legends hint at a source of elven immortality, though most assume it is symbolic or long forgotten.

## Modern Threats and Rediscovery

The Fountain’s magic is believed to be gone, but remnants of its influence or power may still exist:

- The Ruins of the Fountain – The physical site of the Fountain may still exist, buried beneath the jungles or lost cities of Old Selvea.
- Elven Purists Seeking to Restore It – Certain factions, such as the [[Elven Purists]], may be searching for a way to reopen the tear and restore elven immortality, even at the risk of another catastrophe.
- The Tear May Not Be Fully Closed – The original rift may still exist in a weakened or dormant state, and if someone were to reactivate the Fountain, it could reopen.
- The Feywild Has Not Forgotten – If the elves once made a bargain with the Fey, there may be forces beyond the tear waiting for a chance to reclaim what was lost.

## Conclusion

The Fountain of Blood remains one of the greatest lost secrets of elven history. While modern Selvean elves have adapted to mortality, the legacy of the Fountain still lingers—in their rituals, in the whispers of the Purists, and in the ruins waiting to be uncovered. If anyone were to rediscover its power, they could change the fate of elvenkind forever—or risk repeating the disaster that led to the Great Burning.


Excellent—this new direction adds both mythic grandeur and political sharpness to the Fountain's legacy. Here’s a comprehensive rewrite that incorporates your points:

The Fountain of Blood

Mythic Origin: Birth from the Tear

According to the oldest Selvean myths—now fragmented and half-buried under centuries of ash and ruin—the elves themselves did not evolve from this world, but emerged from a tear in reality, a rift between the Material Plane and the Feywild. This tear pulsed with raw life-energy, a metaphysical umbilical cord through which the first elves flowed, formed not of flesh but of resonance, dream, and blood.

At the base of this tear, beneath a dense jungle canopy, the Fountain of Blood began to swell—a basin where matter and magic intermingled. As more elves crossed through the tear and were anchored to the mortal world, they discovered that their vitality and arcane potency were fading unless a price was paid.

That price was blood.



The Bargain of Sacrifice

To remain in this world and retain their power, the elves struck an unspoken covenant with the Fountain: it would remain open, sustaining their long lives and magical inheritance, if they fed it in turn. Blood became the medium of exchange—ritualized, sanctified, and eventually institutionalized. The Fountain’s magic flowed outward from the jungle heart like veins across the land, empowering all Selvean elves—not individually, but ancestrally.

How It Worked

Life flows from the Tear into the Fountain. It diffuses through the ley-bloodlines of all who share the elves’ origin, nourishing longevity and magic.

Ritual blood sacrifice powers the system. Without continuous offerings, the tear would seal shut.

Sacrifices were not symbolic. Enemies of the state, condemned criminals, heretics, and occasionally exalted volunteers were bled or killed upon obsidian altars near the Fountain’s basin.

Some rites focused on specific organs or emotions—a heart torn from a willing martyr, the blood of a mother slain by her child, etc.—believed to invoke stronger energies.

High Ritualists maintained the precise mathematical balance of blood needed across generations to keep the system in equilibrium.

Selvean Society During the Age of the Fountain

Not a secret: The Fountain and its rituals were state institutions. Every Selvean knew where their magic and years came from. The rituals were public, celebratory, and often theatrical.

Festivals of Life and Loss were held seasonally, featuring grand parades, sacrifices, and renewal chants sung in triple harmony across blood-lit plazas.

Blood was patriotic. To sacrifice an enemy—or oneself—was seen as the highest form of service.

A caste of priest-rulers, known as the Blood Chorus, maintained the Fountain, and all laws flowed from their interpretation of its needs.

Some citizens bred animals and even criminals for future offerings, leading to a brutal underclass system that Selvean poets later called "the debt of veins."

The Collapse and the Great Burning

Centuries into this golden age, something changed. Some say the Fountain hungered faster than it used to. Others whispered that the tear was weakening, or that Feywild powers on the far side were pulling it closed. The Blood Chorus, desperate to preserve their world, began exceeding the ancient balance—slaughtering by the thousands.

The Fountain, overwhelmed by incompatible souls, shattered. The tear collapsed inward, like a wound suddenly clotting.

Magic fractured. Elves far from the Fountain aged overnight. In coastal cities, entire libraries turned to salt.

The Jungle Closed. Trees twisted and swallowed stone. The valley that housed the Fountain vanished under centuries of growth, vines, and memory.

The Great Burning followed. Survivors, terrified of history repeating, obliterated all written records of the Fountain: maps, chants, rituals, even the names of the Blood Chorus.

But they could not erase the habit of blood. Even in modern Selvea, ritual bloodletting remains central to funerals, blessings, childbirth rites, and seasonal magic. It's no longer seen as Fountain-related by the public—but it is.

Modern Era: Rediscovery, Myth, and Ambition

Steorrian Explorers

Some Steorrian scholars believe the elves once possessed a secret to functional immortality, and that it lies somewhere in the jungle ruins of Domiselvea. Expeditions have begun—quietly funded by Steorrian nobles and old families obsessed with halting their aging bloodlines.

Some seek academic discovery.

Others are more ruthless—willing to reopen the Fountain by any means, convinced its power can be transferred to humans.


Elven Purists

A radical movement has gained traction in Selvea and among its diaspora: the Elven Purists. They believe:

Elf blood is inherently superior—not by culture, but by origin, born of the Fountain and thus cosmically elevated.

The loss of the Fountain has diluted elven majesty. Reopening it would restore the elves to their "original state."

Some factions within the Purists want to purge the bloodlines they consider too far removed or tainted by human mingling.


Some Purists want to recreate the original crossing, believing the tear can be reopened and new elves can be born—not of wombs, but of blood and magic.

Campaign Hooks

The Jungle Breaths Again: Vines part. A temple door cracks open for the first time in 800 years. A blood-stained glyph pulses faintly in the dark.

One Step Too Far: A Purist cult obtains the bloodline of a royal elf and prepares to offer it in ritual. If successful, the Fountain may begin to stir.

A False Fountain: Steorrian alchemists create a synthetic version. It grants short-term power—then collapses the body from the inside.

Blood Echoes: PCs with Selvean blood begin to have shared dreams. Somewhere, the Jungle is remembering itself.
