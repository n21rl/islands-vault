Here's all the context
Here’s a comprehensive primer that sets the stage for Natzli’s Chronicle within the campaign world. This summary synthesizes the relevant historical, mystical, and geopolitical lore from your uploaded documents and the game so far.

III. The Fountain of Blood: Root of the Curse

Long before current times, the Fountain of Blood pulsed beneath the earth. It was a faerie-origin wellspring of power, hidden deep beneath Selvea’s heartland. The elves built shrines and priesthoods around it, offering sacrifices to keep its magic stable.

One such priest was Natzli, the last and greatest High Priest of the Fountain.  Several thousand years ago, Natzli led blood-rites that empowered Selvea. But something went wrong—the Fountain cracked. In that moment, the Drowsy One emerged and possessed Natzli, binding herself to him through dream and blood.



V. The Servitors and the Rise of Soft Power

After the fall of the Fountain, Natzli manipulated Tzelua, a Selvean oracle, into creating a lineage of masked agents: The Servitors of the Veiled Line. These agents subtly influenced Selvea’s diplomacy, spreading its ideology not through conquest but through treaties, rituals, and “sacred truths.”

These Laced Concords spread across the Islands—until Selvea turned on Natzli, reclaiming power and purging the Servitors.

VI. Natzli’s Fall and Exile

Natzli’s story is one of power, ritual, loss, and slow corruption:

Murdered his own acolytes to maintain control

Lost sacred relics (like the Book of Names) to rival spirits

Abandoned his alliances as Selvea cracked down

Confessed his crimes to Inilsa, an island war-leader turned lover, who shares his hatred of empire

Now he hides in shadow, marked by perpetual bleeding, still whispering through masks and memory.

### 📜 **The Story So Far**

Natzli was born 2000 years before the campaign, in the glory-days of Selvea, chosen as **High Priest of the Fountain of Blood** — a role both political and mystical. Her charge was to oversee sacred sacrifices, ensure the Fountain flowed with power, and guard its secrets. The Keeper and Speaker of Selvea deferred to her; her apprentice Kēlli followed her like a shadow.

She ruled the court of blood with skill:

- **Ritual bloodletting and sacrifice**, performed with precision.
- **Incantations to calm sacrifices**, keeping fear from marring the magic.
- **Deep knowledge of the Fountain’s workings**, its channels, its cycles.

But the Fountain collapsed in a ritual gone wrong. A tear opened. From it crawled **the Drowsy One** — a hag-spirit that took her as a vessel, marking her forever. She began to sweat, weep, and urinate blood; the rites were now her body.

Over centuries, she adapted — guiding Selvea’s policy through generations of Speakers, sending her influence out to the other islands via soft power and masked servants. She kept her robes, her prayer bowl, her line of veiled servitors.

But she also **lost** much:

- The **ritual blade**, cast away when her rites became politically dangerous.
- The **Book of Names**, stolen and destroyed by a sea hag, Virella.
- The **Laced Concords**, burned when Selvea reclaimed control.

Her web shrank. Her enemies multiplied. She killed the ambitious Etzehua, a descendant of her loyal Speaker, in a calculated political murder — not for blood, but for power. Selvea hunted her, and she fled into the shadows, confessing her crimes to **Inilsa**, a rebel island-governor who became both her lover and occasional ally.

Now she wanders the islands, trailing the Drowsy One’s influence — hunted by old powers, bound to new dangers, and weighed down by memories she can neither forget nor fully keep.

### 🧠 **Memories & Experiences**

#### **Memory 1: The Priest and the Policy** _(Full)_

- I was High Priest of the Fountain of Blood in the heart of Old Selvea, chosen by omens and crowned in petals. I oversaw the rites. They feared me—and that was enough.
- I performed the rites myself, even when I no longer needed to. The Ritual Blade never dulled, and my hands did not tremble.
- Through the masked descendants of Tzelua, I whisper policy. They offer guidance, gifts, dream-salts. Selvea does not conquer—it influences. One island at a time bends to our customs.

#### **Memory 2: Names and Silence**

- Each time the Fountain stirred, I recorded it in the Book of Names. Some names were repeated. I said nothing. The book grew heavy in my hands.
- Virella saw the Book and cackled. She said it belonged to the dead. She fed it to her crustacean bride. I did not stop her.

#### **Memory 3: The Robes of Collapse** _(Full)_

- When I entered the ritual court in full regalia, silence fell. Even Ixotli bowed her head. In those folds, I hid secrets no priest should carry.
- Ixotli dismantled the priesthood, fearing what Tzelua had become. They came for me at dusk. I charmed them and vanished. Thanda Vire took me in. She taught me to breathe beneath law.
- They reclaimed the temples. The Speaker's line was purged, the Concords seized. I fled through shadow. On a small island, I confessed to its war-born governor. She saw in me a mirror—and offered her bed.

#### **Memory 4: The Speaker’s Line**

- Tzelua knelt. He said I had crossed the Veil. I told him what to do. He burned the records. His children still wear his mask—and serve me.
- Etzehua, his descendant, dreamed too loud. I slit her throat in silence, with perfect form. I told the others she had grown too powerful. Her blood steamed in the bowl.

#### **Memory 5: The Hollowing**

- The Fountain cracked and swallowed its own veins. The Drowsy One entered me like fog. I did not die.
- Kēlli found me crouched in the dust, weeping blood. I could not chant. They burned dream-herbs. I breathed. I lived.
