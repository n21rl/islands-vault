In the wake of rising tensions across the Jaw, **Paxitli**, the Selvean Envoy of the Jaw, has undertaken a **covert mission** to observe the region first-hand and carry out diplomacy with Steorrians up north. Rather than travel under their official identity, Paxitli has executed a carefully orchestrated **identity switch** with a trusted Spirit Path finalist: **Palomi**.

### The Switch

- **The real Palomi** has assumed Paxitli’s public duties in **Harboursjaw**, maintaining appearances in the governor’s court and continuing administrative work. This arrangement ensures continuity of leadership and minimizes suspicion.
- **Paxitli**, now traveling under the guise of **Palomi**, has joined the **northbound convoy**, using the Spirit Path finalist’s persona as cover to monitor political currents, uncover unrest, and assess the true nature of events unfolding beyond the capital.

### Physical Disguise

- To complete the disguise, **Paxitli shaved their head**, fully matching Palomi’s distinctive look—a clean, symbolic act representing transformation and commitment to the mission.
- They wear a **plain grey cloak**
### Purpose

- **Observe without bias**: Paxitli seeks to understand the realities of the Jaw—especially rural tensions, Steorrian and Jawist movements—without the distortions caused by their official presence.
- **Avoid assassination or sabotage**: With rising instability, maintaining a low profile also ensures personal safety.
- **Bridge the divide**: As a Child of the Gloam, Paxitli believes true leadership requires empathy from all levels—something they can only earn by walking the land themselves.

### Operational Risks

- If **Tzecto** or any faction (e.g., Jawists, Loyalists, or Steorrians) discovers the deception, the political fallout could be explosive.
- If **Palomi is compromised** in Harboursjaw, Paxitli may lose the cover necessary to finish their mission.
- Should the **party uncover the truth**, it could either forge a powerful alliance—or ignite serious mistrust depending on their values.
