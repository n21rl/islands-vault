Many “miracles” likely trace to the Star not as a god but as a volatile tear in reality, plus powerful relics and later hagiographic smoothing for doctrine and politics. These apocrypha surface in forbidden texts, political chronicles, and marginal notes that the Church downplays or suppresses. 

## Astron
- Tutored by a disavowed star‑reader: folk accounts name a wanderer “Myrddin” who taught astral reading, which the Church rejects to keep Astron’s wisdom “purely” divine.
- Sword as Star‑tech: Hardblade was forged from a Star shard; if the Star is a tear not a deity, his “miracles” were channeled phenomena, not ex nihilo wonders. [5][2]
- “Ascension” as rift‑crossing: no body, no sword; alternative reports say he sailed back to the shard’s isle and passed through a rent, later canonized as a holy departure. [5]

## Weland
- Star‑metal craft, not magic: his greatest work depended on shard‑matter properties; the Church’s anti‑sorcery line masks that his forge mastery exploited a dangerous, extra‑mundane substance. [6][2]
- Disappearance by design: the “stepping into the flames” may veil an engineered blast or passage tied to star‑forging, leaving only the untarnished anvil as a sanctioned relic. [6][4]

## Brenna
- Following Astron’s wake: later notes say her eastward voyage consciously traced Astron’s last course toward the shard‑isle, implying intent to cross the same threshold. [5]
- Crewless return explained: if the Star is a tear, “I am going forward” can read as a voluntary crossing rather than a miracle or tragedy at sea. [6][2]

## Rochel
- Wound that “never festered”: interpreted as sanctity, but could be long exposure to Star‑adjacent effects or compounds that alter healing and sensation without true divine suspension. [6][2]
- Hallow’s “apparitions”: the hound’s cult grew after her death; sightings likely memorial phenomena co‑opted as proof of ongoing intercession. [6][4]

## Saulina
- Conversion mechanism: “the Star burned her sight away” aligns with blinding exposure to a Star‑tear, reframed as instantaneous grace rather than hazardous contact. [6][2]
- Trial of Roemeg: the “singing in the flames” became emblematic; later editors amplified the motif to model fearless proclamation, muting earlier records of her as an effective persecutor. [6][4]

## Dorian
- The first **corona** displaced sin: his unaging purity likely came from an iron band that externalized corruption; imitator bands cause agony, contradicting the public tale of serene sanctity. [5]
- A doctrine built on omission: the original corona may be a decayed receptacle of centuries of vice; its existence and function are theologically explosive, so it is sealed or erased. [5]

## Heorstan
- Battlefield staging vs. miracle: “found still standing, propped” suggests the image was curated as a fortitude catechism, later standardized to a wonder. [6]
- Martial myth for crises: his legend was redeployed to enforce obedience and sacrifice in later Church–Crown conflicts (e.g., Temple War), blurring history and homily. [3]

## Cyridith
- Texts beyond the Church: creating the Steorrian script empowered plural legal and scholarly traditions the Church later sought to centralize, prompting her drastic refusal to authenticate edits. [6][4]
- Posthumous redaction: successive regimes and councils reshaped her corpus to suit policy, then retrofitted piety to those changes, while presenting an unbroken line of orthodoxy. [3][4]

## Systemic truths
- The Star is a tear: not a personal deity; saints’ “miracles” cluster around tears, relics, and disciplined institutions, not unilateral divine fiat. [1][2]
- Hagiography as statecraft: lives were polished to legitimize expansion, hierarchy, and wars of order, with dissenting strata relegated to “forbidden” or “heretical” shelves. [3][4]
