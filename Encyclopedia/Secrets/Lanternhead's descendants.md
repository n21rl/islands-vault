## 1st Generation: Oraya I
- Lanternhead’s firstborn daughter, Mo's great-great-grandmother
- Born ~144 years ago.
- Born shortly before Lanternhead’s capture.
- Grew up in a collapsing world—her father was taken, and Steorrian settlers were moving in fast.
- Her mother, desperate to protect her, fled their homeland and sought refuge with another native group.
- Lived through early Steorrian colonization, witnessing her people’s displacement firsthand.
- Became a quiet, determined woman, trying to preserve their ways in secret, but unable to stop the tide of change.
- Had one child, a son, whom she named Veylan—wanting him to have a different fate than hers.

## 2nd Generation: Veylan Doltha
- Lanternhead's grandson, Mo's great-grandfather
- Born ~114 years ago
- The first in the bloodline to take the surname Doltha—a name meaning _"roots" or "buried ones"_
- Grew up knowing stories of his lost grandfather, but they were already fading into myth.
- Lived in a time when Steorrian rule was absolute, and native culture was pushed underground.
- Unlike his mother, Veylan chose to assimilate—he worked as a guide for Steorrian traders, leading them through the wilds of the Jaw.
- Eventually settled in a mixed settlement, marrying a woman of Steorrian heritage.
- Named his daughter Oraya II, but by now, the name had lost its full meaning—it was just a his grandmother's name.

## 3rd Generation: Oraya II Doltha 
- Lanternhead's great-granddaughter, Mo's grandmother 
- Born ~84 years ago
- Raised in a hybrid world, where Steorrian rule was the norm and many native people had mixed ancestry.
- She never knew what her name meant—it was just something passed down, a family tradition.
- Unlike her grandfather, she despised Steorrian rule and spent her life resisting cultural erasure.
- She became a secretive historian, gathering old stories from the Jaw’s past, trying to preserve what little was left.
- Eventually fled Steorrian society, joining a group of Selvean-allied natives who were waiting for war.
- She had a son, named Rilith, born in the years when war between Steorr and Selvea seemed inevitable.

## 4th Generation: Rilith Doltha
- Lanternhead's great-great-grandson, Mo's father 
- Born ~54 years ago
- Born into a world of war. By the time he was a young man, Steorr and Selvea were fighting for control of the Jaw.
- Unlike his mother, Rilith wasn’t a historian—he was a warrior.
- He fought with Selvean-backed native resistance groups, striking against Steorrian forts and traders.
- Wounded in battle, captured, and then released by Selveans who wanted to absorb his people into their own forces.
- Became disillusioned with Selvea—he fought for native independence, not another foreign empire.
- Tried to flee the Jaw with his family, hoping to escape the cycle of war and oppression.
- Boarded a ship bound for freedom. It sank in a storm.

## 5th Generation: Oraya III (Mo) 
- ~24 years ago
- Born from the last remnant of a forgotten bloodline.
- The only known survivor of her family after the shipwreck.
- Taken in by Granny Moon, raised in Harboursjaw with no knowledge of her heritage.
- Doesn’t know what her name means; received the nickname Mo
- Carries the last echoes of a lost history—but is she meant to reclaim it, or create something new?



- Each generation adapted differently: Some tried to preserve the past, some fought for change, and some tried to escape.
- The name Oraya survived because it meant different things to different people:
    - Oraya I named her son something else, but the name was still remembered.
    - Oraya II received it as tradition, but she didn’t know its true meaning.
    - Oraya III (Mo) was named after a family legacy that no one fully understood anymore.
