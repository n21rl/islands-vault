The party has made their way to the floating shipwreck of the Arrow to salvage cargo. A human druid and crustacean creatures had made their home there and fought the adventurers. Unbeknownst to the party, the druid was working for a fiendish tongue-eating louse named Cymothoalix that lived in his mouth. The fiend can attach to a humanoid's tongue and attempt to control its actions. The druid was a willing victim. The party defeated the druid and his beasts but they don't know that Cymothoalix is currently hiding aboard their ship. He plans to take revenge and capture their ship for himself.

***Spider Climb.*** Cymothoalix can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Ethereal Jaunt.*** As a bonus action, Cymothoalix can magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. 

***Attach.*** On a successful Bite aimed its tongue, the target must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or Cymothoalix attaches to its tongue. 

***Detach.*** Cymothoalix can detach as a bonus action and appear in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. Another creature can use their action to attempt to detach Cymothoalix by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The target takes 1d4 slashing damage.

***Psychic Possession.*** While attached to a target's tongue, Cymothoalix can exert increasing psychic control over the target. At the end of each of the target's turns, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or Cymothoalix's control progresses one stage further toward domination (see Possession Stages below). On a successful save, Cymothoalix's control regresses one stage away from domination. 

Once Cymothoalix gains full control, the target only gets one opportunity to repeat the saving throw at the end of each day, rather than at the end of each turn. The DC increases by 1 each day Cymothoalix remains attached.

***Possession Stages:***

- **1st Stage:** Target cannot speak, Cymothoalix speaks telepathically to it only. 

- **2nd Stage:** Cymothoalix controls target's movement but not actions.

- **3rd Stage:** Cymothoalix fully controls target's actions, speech, and movement.

If Cymothoalix detaches, the possession immediately ends.
 
***Tongue Atrophy.*** The tongue of a target under Cymothoalix's control for over 24 hours becomes blackened and atrophied. The damage is permanent, as the tongue does not regrow. The target is unable to speak unless healed by magic like Greater Restoration.
