Gideon Fletcher is a seasoned Steorrian merdenary who has been tasked by Lord Mayor Brummbär of Sealtham to lead the pirate-hunting expedition in the Northern Scattered Isles. He is to eliminate the pirate threat and retrieving the valuable magic items stolen from Steorrian ships. He is a formidable and ruthless individual,


From his outpost, Fletcher coordinates Steorrian naval patrols and intelligence-gathering efforts, tracking the movements of pirate crews and attempting to disrupt their supply lines. His ultimate goal is to cripple the Republic's ability to operate, allowing Steorr to reassert its control over the lucrative trade routes and magic item smuggling networks.

Beyond the immediate concerns of the pirate threat, Fletcher also seeks to expand Steorr's colonial foothold in the Northern Scattered Isles. He has authorized the recruitment of additional settlers, both from the Old Lands and from other parts of the archipelago, to establish new outposts and settlements. These efforts are not only aimed at securing resources and trade routes but also at projecting Steorr's power and influence in the region

Another key figure in the anti-pirate efforts is Gideon Fletcher. Fletcher has taken an aggressive stance against the Republic, successfully attacking the ship of Luna Mahina, captain of the Night Owls. In a strategic move, Fletcher has established a base of operations in the Northern Scattered Isles, allowing for sustained anti-pirate raids in the region. This forward operating base poses a significant threat to the Republic's activities and the security of New Destiny.




Gideon Fletcher has established a base on a nearby island. This strategic position allows him to monitor and potentially disrupt the Republic's activities. His alliance with Sealtham provides him with additional resources and legitimacy, making him an even more dangerous adversary.

Fletcher's tactics are a blend of military might and political manipulation. He is not above forming alliances with other factions, such as the Siblín Guilds, if it serves his ultimate goal of eliminating the Republic and solidifying Steorr's control over the islands. His ruthless disregard for the well-being of the local population has earned him a reputation as a brutal and unyielding commander, willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his objectives.




## Potential Missions

1. Reconnaissance: The party could be tasked with secretly scouting Fletcher's new base to assess its defenses, size of forces, and overall capabilities.
2. Sabotage: Infiltrate Fletcher's camp to destroy supplies, damage ships, or otherwise hinder their operations without being detected.
3. Diplomacy: Attempt to negotiate with Fletcher or find leverage to convince him to leave the area. This could involve uncovering secrets about him or finding something he values more than hunting pirates.
4. Counter-Intelligence: Plant false information to misdirect Fletcher's efforts away from New Destiny and the Republic's activities.
5. Alliance Breaking: Find a way to drive a wedge between Fletcher and Sealtham, possibly by exposing any unsavory tactics Fletcher might be using.
6. Evacuation Planning: Develop and prepare to execute an emergency plan to evacuate New Destiny if Fletcher's presence becomes too threatening.
7. Fortification: Improve New Destiny's defenses in preparation for a potential attack from Fletcher's forces.
8. Recruitment: Seek out and recruit other pirate crews or even former victims of Sealtham's corruption to bolster the Republic's strength against this new threat.
9. Misinformation Campaign: Spread rumors and false information about the Republic's location and activities to throw Fletcher off the scent.
10. Hostage Rescue: If Fletcher manages to capture any Republic members, mount a rescue mission to free them before they can reveal crucial information.

# Fletcher's Outpost

Fletcher's base is situated on a remote and inhospitable island, chosen for its strategic location and natural defenses. The outpost, a fortified encampment with a small harbor, serves as a staging ground for Fletcher's operations, as well as a supply depot for Steorrian ships and soldiers.

## Location
The base is located on a small island in the Northern Scattered Isles, occupying an old Steorrian fort from a previous, failed attempt at colonization. The island has a natural harbor on its southern side.

## Establishment
Gideon Fletcher initially arrived with one ship and a small crew. He quickly:
1. Secured the old fort
2. Requisitioned ships and resources from nearby independent islands
3. Established the base as a center for anti-pirate operations

Once Lord Mayor Brummbär received word of Fletcher's success, he sent additional ships and reinforcements to bolster the operation.

## Layout

### The Harbor
- A serviceable harbor with space for five to six ships
- Remnants of old Steorrian defenses, some of which have been repaired
- Several ballistae installed on the harbor walls
- The old lighthouse recommissioned as a watchtower

### The Fort
- An existing Steorrian fort, rapidly being restored to full functionality
- Thick stone walls surround the main compound
- Two main levels with a partial underground section

### Key Areas
1. Command Center: Established in the former fort commander's quarters
2. Barracks: Repurposed from old soldier quarters, now crowded with new recruits
3. Armory: Using the existing armory, restocked with weapons from Steorr and requisitioned items
4. Shipyard: Expanded repair facilities in the harbor
5. Prison: Former fort dungeons now used to hold captured pirates
6. Training Area: The fort's courtyard, busy with constant drills
7. Mess Hall and Kitchens: Expanded to handle increased personnel
8. Infirmary: Set up in a cleared out storage room
9. Storehouses: Filled with supplies from Steorr and requisitioned goods
10. Lookout Tower: The highest point of the fort, offering a good vantage point

## Defenses
- Restored and reinforced fort walls
- Multiple ballistae placed at strategic points
- A fleet of 4-5 patrol ships constantly circling the island
- Lookouts posted at all times
- Steorrian-made anti-pirate devices (e.g., reinforced hulls, grappling countermeasures)

## Personnel
- Gideon Fletcher: The base commander
- A growing contingent of naval officers and marines from Steorr
- Locally requisitioned sailors and fighters
- Support staff (cooks, medics, etc.) from both Steorr and local populations

## Current Activities
- Continuing to repair and expand the fort's facilities
- Coordinating an increasing number of anti-pirate patrols
- Gathering and analyzing intelligence about pirate movements and the Republic
- Interrogating captured pirates for information
- Establishing and maintaining supply lines back to Steorrian-controlled territories
- Training new recruits in anti-pirate tactics
- Diplomatic efforts to gain more support from independent islands

This revised version reflects Fletcher's quick action in establishing the base, his use of local resources, and the subsequent reinforcement from Steorr. The base is rapidly growing in strength and poses an increasing threat to the Republic and other pirate operations in the area, all without the use of magic, in line with Steorrian practices.
