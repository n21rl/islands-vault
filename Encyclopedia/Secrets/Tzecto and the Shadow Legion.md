campaign: "[[A Province on the Edge]]"

Champion-General [[Tzecto]] of the Jaw is more than Selvea’s highest military authority in the region—he is the invisible architect of its future war, the hand that will push Selvea back onto the path of conquest. His official role is to enforce imperial rule in the Jaw, ensuring stability and dominance. His true purpose, however, is far more ambitious: he is preparing Selvea for war against Steorr, and he will not stop until it comes.

The Shadow Legion is his instrument—a hidden force, woven into the very fabric of Selvean power in the Jaw. It is not an official army, but a mechanism of control and escalation, designed to ensure that the fragile peace does not last.

Tzecto cannot openly defy the Selvean leadership. He does not yet have the authority to declare war himself—but he does not need to. His goal is far simpler, and far more insidious: To ensure that war becomes inevitable.

## The Shadow Legion’s Mission: Turning the Jaw into a Tinderbox

The Shadow Legion operates exclusively within the Jaw, carefully crafting a reality in which conflict is not just possible—it is unavoidable. Tzecto does not intend to push too hard too soon; he cannot risk drawing the attention of Selvea’s ruling elite before they are ready. Instead, he works from within, manipulating the region’s tensions, destabilizing its factions, and ensuring that peace crumbles from within.

### Methods

#### **Stoking Tensions
- Steorrian settlers and loyalists still operate in the Jaw, holding onto their influence despite Selvea’s rule. They must be provoked, radicalized, made into a threat that Selvea cannot ignore.
- The Shadow Legion works to fan the flames of resentment, orchestrating assassinations, disappearances, and calculated acts of violence that appear to be the work of Steorrians.
- Every act of chaos is designed to make the Steorrians look like aggressors, justifying an eventual crackdown and pushing Selvea toward military intervention.

#### Crushing Autonomy Movements
- Some factions within the Jaw seek **self-rule**, hoping to break free from both Steorrian and Selvean control. Tzecto sees them as **deluded obstacles in his grander war**—they must be eliminated.****
- Jawist leaders are **discredited, undermined, or outright eliminated** before they can gain traction.****
- Any native movements that could be useful to the Shadow Legion are **secretly guided toward violence**, turning them into further justification for increased military presence.

#### Controlling Narrative
- While working in the shadows, Tzecto ensures that the official Selvean military appears to be acting in good faith.
- Every act of sabotage or political manipulation is framed as a natural escalation of existing tensions.
- Selvean diplomats continue to push for stability—while the Shadow Legion ensures it never comes.

#### Preparing for War
- Select warriors within the Champions are quietly indoctrinated into the Legion’s true purpose, ensuring that when war does break out, they will fight with absolute conviction.
- Tzecto ensures that the Jaw’s military presence grows under the guise of maintaining order, allowing him to assemble the perfect army for the war to come.
## The Endgame: Forcing Selvea’s Hand

Tzecto does not seek rebellion. He does not intend to rise against Selvea’s leadership or claim independent power. He wants Selvea to go to war—but on its own terms.

By the time the Shadow Legion’s work is complete, Selvea’s rulers will not see a rogue general demanding war. They will see a province on the brink of collapse, a fragile conquest being threatened by Steorr, by rebellious factions, by growing instability. They will see no choice but to act.

They will decide, on their own, that war must come. And when they do, Tzecto will already be prepared.
