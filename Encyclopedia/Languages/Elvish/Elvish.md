Elvish is a language mostly spoken by elves. There are two main variants.

The Elvish language family, known for its fluidity and melodic structure, is spoken mostly by elves across the world, with two main dialects: Island Elvish (also referred to as Selvean Elvish) and Old Lands Elvish (or Steorrian Elvish). Both dialects seem stem from a common ancestral language, reflecting deep-rooted connections between their speakers, while diverging over time due to geographic separation and cultural development. Despite these differences, the two dialects remain mutually intelligible, although distinct in sound, vocabulary, and cultural significance.

At its core, Elvish is characterized by a rich phonological system with vowel harmony, a reliance on consonant clusters, and a preference for polysyllabic word forms. The language exhibits a moderate degree of inflection, with verbs, nouns, and adjectives marked by suffixes that convey tense, plurality, and degree, respectively. Word formation often relies on root-stem modification, allowing for the creation of complex yet harmonious words that reflect the environment and worldview of the speakers. Both dialects draw from this shared linguistic foundation but manifest unique features that reflect the diverging histories and settings of their speakers.


The Elvish language family is spoken across the lands of Selvea and Steorr, divided into two main dialects: Island Elvish (also known as Selvean Elvish) and Old Lands Elvish (or Steorrian Elvish). Both dialects stem from a common ancient root, and while they diverged over centuries due to environmental and cultural shifts, they remain mutually intelligible. Each dialect reflects the unique values, history, and surroundings of its speakers, with Selvean Elvish echoing the vitality of the islands and the coast, and Steorrian Elvish preserving the richness of the old forests and mountains.


Comparative Linguistic Features

Both dialects of Elvish, while sharing common roots, offer unique reflections of the lands and cultures that speak them. Selvean Elvish is marked by its energy, sharp consonants, and an emphasis on dynamic action. It favors shorter, rhythmic word structures that mirror the constant movement of the islands and the sea. Meanwhile, Steorrian Elvish retains a more flowing, harmonic quality, with longer word forms and a focus on continuity and tradition, shaped by the deep forests and enduring mountains of the mainland.

Despite these differences, the two dialects remain mutually intelligible, a testament to their shared origin. Speakers of one dialect can easily understand the other, though they may notice that certain sounds, stress patterns, or word formations shift depending on the region. This linguistic connection serves as a bridge between the two peoples, reflecting their shared history while honoring the distinct paths their cultures have taken.

In conclusion, Selvean Elvish captures the rhythm and energy of coastal and island life with its compact, consonant-rich sounds, while Steorrian Elvish offers a more flowing, structured, and historically grounded dialect that mirrors the enduring landscapes of the Old Lands. Both dialects, though divergent, continue to evolve, yet they retain a deep linguistic kinship.
