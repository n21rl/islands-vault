Elvish is a language mostly spoken by elves. There are two main variants.

The Elvish language family, known for its fluidity and melodic structure, is spoken mostly by elves across the world, with two main dialects: Island Elvish (also referred to as Selvean Elvish) and Old Lands Elvish (or Steorrian Elvish). Both dialects seem stem from a common ancestral language, reflecting deep-rooted connections between their speakers, while diverging over time due to geographic separation and cultural development. Despite these differences, the two dialects remain mutually intelligible, although distinct in sound, vocabulary, and cultural significance.

At its core, Elvish is characterized by a rich phonological system with vowel harmony, a reliance on consonant clusters, and a preference for polysyllabic word forms. The language exhibits a moderate degree of inflection, with verbs, nouns, and adjectives marked by suffixes that convey tense, plurality, and degree, respectively. Word formation often relies on root-stem modification, allowing for the creation of complex yet harmonious words that reflect the environment and worldview of the speakers. Both dialects draw from this shared linguistic foundation but manifest unique features that reflect the diverging histories and settings of their speakers.

Island Elvish (Selvean Elvish)

Island Elvish, spoken primarily in Selvea, developed under the influence of the coastal and island environments of the southern lands. This dialect is known for its emphasis on fluidity and cadence, shaped by the natural sounds of the ocean and the winds that sweep through the islands. The phonetic structure favors softer consonants, such as l, m, n, r, and s, with a preference for open vowels, creating a smooth and lilting quality to the language. The syllabic structure is typically light, and there is a tendency for vowels to be drawn out, particularly in stressed syllables, contributing to the language’s melodic character.

Lexically, Island Elvish is rich in words related to nature, particularly the sea, rivers, and winds, reflecting the close connection the Selvean elves have with their environment. Words like Selvea (meaning "great forest") and Toroka (from Torroccia, meaning "rocky heights") showcase this natural affinity, where the vocabulary often conveys movement, growth, or change. Even as the dialect diverged from its mainland counterpart, it retained a sense of unity through shared cultural heritage.

In names and places, Island Elvish tends toward shorter, more rhythmic forms, though still retaining a connection to the longer polysyllabic names of the parent language. For example, the place name Meritlan (a variation of Meridion, meaning "southern land") demonstrates a blend of the root meanings from the old language with the more clipped, direct phonetic structures of the island dialect. Similarly, names like Selvaya and Tlokiselva reflect a balance between traditional roots and local linguistic evolution.

Old Lands Elvish (Steorrian Elvish)

Old Lands Elvish, spoken across the mainland in Steorr, retains many of the linguistic features of the ancient Elvish language, though it has evolved in its own way due to the different historical and environmental influences. This dialect is more consonant-heavy, with a greater reliance on hard sounds such as k, t, d, and g, giving it a slightly more structured and formal tone compared to its island counterpart. However, the melodic nature of Elvish as a whole still persists, and vowel harmony remains a key feature.

Steorrian Elvish tends to use longer compound words and is more likely to preserve older, more formal linguistic structures. The consonants are typically more pronounced, with a higher degree of inflection in both verb and noun forms. This gives the dialect a more complex and rhythmic sound, as seen in place names like Domiselvea (from Domiselva, meaning "heart of the forest") and Fiumille (meaning "thousand rivers"). The dialect’s focus on compound nouns and the preservation of multi-syllable roots points to a cultural emphasis on continuity and tradition.

The geographical features of the Old Lands, with their mountains, rivers, and vast forests, have shaped the vocabulary of this dialect. 


You're right that the description should better reflect the specific sound profiles you're aiming for in both dialects. Let's refine the portrayal to capture the unique phonetic, morphological, and cultural characteristics you want for Selvean Elvish and Steorrian Elvish, while still staying within the framework of Elvish languages. This will highlight the distinct influences you're going for without explicitly mentioning their real-world counterparts.

Elvish Language Overview

The Elvish language family is spoken across the lands of Selvea and Steorr, divided into two main dialects: Island Elvish (also known as Selvean Elvish) and Old Lands Elvish (or Steorrian Elvish). Both dialects stem from a common ancient root, and while they diverged over centuries due to environmental and cultural shifts, they remain mutually intelligible. Each dialect reflects the unique values, history, and surroundings of its speakers, with Selvean Elvish echoing the vitality of the islands and the coast, and Steorrian Elvish preserving the richness of the old forests and mountains.

Selvean Elvish (Island Elvish)

Selvean Elvish, spoken by the people of Selvea, is marked by a distinctive phonological style that reflects the energetic, rhythmic patterns of life in their island and coastal environment. The sound of this dialect has a dynamic quality, with strong consonants paired with fluid vowel combinations. The use of tl, k, and x sounds is prominent, which gives the dialect a sense of sharpness, yet it remains melodious through the frequent use of open vowels like a, e, and i. This mix results in a language that feels bold and vibrant, reflecting a connection to the dynamic, ever-changing forces of the ocean and the skies.

The morphology of Selvean Elvish favors shorter, often bisyllabic roots that expand through affixation and compounding. Words tend to be efficient, with each syllable carrying a clear purpose, yet the rhythm remains smooth, giving the language a flowing, connected quality. The dialect is rich in words for water, winds, and movement, reflecting the importance of navigation, trade, and natural cycles in Selvean culture.

For instance, Selvea becomes Selvaya, maintaining the root of "forest" while incorporating the more energetic consonant structure and stress pattern typical of the island dialect. Tlokiselva, a variant of Domiselvea, introduces a more complex consonant cluster, reflecting how the language adapts to express intricate ideas with sharp, compact syllables. Toroka (from Torroccia) and Meritlan (from Meridion) likewise show how Selvean Elvish condenses and reshapes sounds while staying connected to its roots.

The geography and culture of Selvea, dominated by coastlines and the swift movement of water, are reflected in the language's focus on action and change. Place names often carry connotations of motion or elemental power, and even the structure of verbs and nouns tends to emphasize continuous states or shifting conditions. The dialect is particularly evocative when describing natural phenomena, with layered meanings built into single words through compound syllables.

Steorrian Elvish (Old Lands Elvish)

Steorrian Elvish, the dialect spoken across the mainland in Steorr, retains many of the ancient features of the parent language, but its phonology has developed in a way that reflects the grandeur and richness of the mainland’s dense forests, mountains, and rivers. This dialect is marked by soft consonants, especially l, r, and v, and a preference for longer, more melodious word forms. While Steorrian Elvish has a flowing, almost musical quality, it is more measured and refined compared to its island counterpart, favoring rounded vowels like o and u. The syllables are often elongated, giving the dialect a sense of continuity and elegance.

Morphologically, Steorrian Elvish makes extensive use of multi-syllabic roots, with a higher degree of inflection and compounding. Words often have layered meanings, especially those related to ancestry, tradition, and the landscape. This gives the dialect a sense of formality and structure, and it’s common for words to be descriptive or symbolic, mirroring the Elves’ deep respect for heritage and the natural world.

Names like Selvea, Domiselvea, and Fiumille reflect this tradition. Selvea, for example, conveys the idea of "forest" through a soft, flowing series of sounds, while Domiselvea emphasizes the central, almost sacred quality of the heart of the land. Fiumille, meaning "thousand rivers," retains the complex syllabic structure that reflects both the abundance of natural resources and the intricate weaving of cultural ties. The place name Torroccia highlights the focus on the physical landscape, with a strong, memorable form that evokes images of towering mountains and enduring stone.

Culturally, Steorrian Elvish places great importance on history, lineage, and stability. The language mirrors this through its reverence for traditional forms and its emphasis on words that describe permanence, longevity, and the cycles of the natural world. As such, verbs are often marked for continuity, and nouns tend to denote states of being that reflect endurance. The dialect’s structure and vocabulary feel like an expression of time itself, woven into the very syllables spoken by its people.

Comparative Linguistic Features

Both dialects of Elvish, while sharing common roots, offer unique reflections of the lands and cultures that speak them. Selvean Elvish is marked by its energy, sharp consonants, and an emphasis on dynamic action. It favors shorter, rhythmic word structures that mirror the constant movement of the islands and the sea. Meanwhile, Steorrian Elvish retains a more flowing, harmonic quality, with longer word forms and a focus on continuity and tradition, shaped by the deep forests and enduring mountains of the mainland.

Despite these differences, the two dialects remain mutually intelligible, a testament to their shared origin. Speakers of one dialect can easily understand the other, though they may notice that certain sounds, stress patterns, or word formations shift depending on the region. This linguistic connection serves as a bridge between the two peoples, reflecting their shared history while honoring the distinct paths their cultures have taken.

In conclusion, Selvean Elvish captures the rhythm and energy of coastal and island life with its compact, consonant-rich sounds, while Steorrian Elvish offers a more flowing, structured, and historically grounded dialect that mirrors the enduring landscapes of the Old Lands. Both dialects, though divergent, continue to evolve, yet they retain a deep linguistic kinship.
