The variety of Elvish mostly spoken by elves of the [[Islands]] 

Island Elvish, spoken primarily in Selvea, developed under the influence of the coastal and island environments of the southern lands. This dialect is known for its emphasis on fluidity and cadence, shaped by the natural sounds of the ocean and the winds that sweep through the islands. The phonetic structure favors softer consonants, such as l, m, n, r, and s, with a preference for open vowels, creating a smooth and lilting quality to the language. The syllabic structure is typically light, and there is a tendency for vowels to be drawn out, particularly in stressed syllables, contributing to the language’s melodic character.

Lexically, Island Elvish is rich in words related to nature, particularly the sea, rivers, and winds, reflecting the close connection the Selvean elves have with their environment. Words like Selvea (meaning "great forest") and Toroka (from Torroccia, meaning "rocky heights") showcase this natural affinity, where the vocabulary often conveys movement, growth, or change. Even as the dialect diverged from its mainland counterpart, it retained a sense of unity through shared cultural heritage.

In names and places, Island Elvish tends toward shorter, more rhythmic forms, though still retaining a connection to the longer polysyllabic names of the parent language. For example, the place name Meritlan (a variation of Meridion, meaning "southern land") demonstrates a blend of the root meanings from the old language with the more clipped, direct phonetic structures of the island dialect. Similarly, names like Selvaya and Tlokiselva reflect a balance between traditional roots and local linguistic evolution.

Selvean Elvish, spoken by the people of Selvea, is marked by a distinctive phonological style that reflects the energetic, rhythmic patterns of life in their island and coastal environment. The sound of this dialect has a dynamic quality, with strong consonants paired with fluid vowel combinations. The use of tl, k, and x sounds is prominent, which gives the dialect a sense of sharpness, yet it remains melodious through the frequent use of open vowels like a, e, and i. This mix results in a language that feels bold and vibrant, reflecting a connection to the dynamic, ever-changing forces of the ocean and the skies.

The morphology of Selvean Elvish favors shorter, often bisyllabic roots that expand through affixation and compounding. Words tend to be efficient, with each syllable carrying a clear purpose, yet the rhythm remains smooth, giving the language a flowing, connected quality. The dialect is rich in words for water, winds, and movement, reflecting the importance of navigation, trade, and natural cycles in Selvean culture.

For instance, Selvea becomes Selvaya, maintaining the root of "forest" while incorporating the more energetic consonant structure and stress pattern typical of the island dialect. Tlokiselva, a variant of Domiselvea, introduces a more complex consonant cluster, reflecting how the language adapts to express intricate ideas with sharp, compact syllables. Toroka (from Torroccia) and Meritlan (from Meridion) likewise show how Selvean Elvish condenses and reshapes sounds while staying connected to its roots.

The geography and culture of Selvea, dominated by coastlines and the swift movement of water, are reflected in the language's focus on action and change. Place names often carry connotations of motion or elemental power, and even the structure of verbs and nouns tends to emphasize continuous states or shifting conditions. The dialect is particularly evocative when describing natural phenomena, with layered meanings built into single words through compound syllables.
