The variety of Elvish mostly spoken by elves of the [[Old Lands]] 

Old Lands Elvish, spoken across the mainland in Steorr, retains many of the linguistic features of the ancient Elvish language, though it has evolved in its own way due to the different historical and environmental influences. This dialect is more consonant-heavy, with a greater reliance on hard sounds such as k, t, d, and g, giving it a slightly more structured and formal tone compared to its island counterpart. However, the melodic nature of Elvish as a whole still persists, and vowel harmony remains a key feature.

Steorrian Elvish tends to use longer compound words and is more likely to preserve older, more formal linguistic structures. The consonants are typically more pronounced, with a higher degree of inflection in both verb and noun forms. This gives the dialect a more complex and rhythmic sound, as seen in place names like Domiselvea (from Domiselva, meaning "heart of the forest") and Fiumille (meaning "thousand rivers"). The dialect’s focus on compound nouns and the preservation of multi-syllable roots points to a cultural emphasis on continuity and tradition.

The geographical features of the Old Lands, with their mountains, rivers, and vast forests, have shaped the vocabulary of this dialect. 

Steorrian Elvish, the dialect spoken across the mainland in Steorr, retains many of the ancient features of the parent language, but its phonology has developed in a way that reflects the grandeur and richness of the mainland’s dense forests, mountains, and rivers. This dialect is marked by soft consonants, especially l, r, and v, and a preference for longer, more melodious word forms. While Steorrian Elvish has a flowing, almost musical quality, it is more measured and refined compared to its island counterpart, favoring rounded vowels like o and u. The syllables are often elongated, giving the dialect a sense of continuity and elegance.

Morphologically, Steorrian Elvish makes extensive use of multi-syllabic roots, with a higher degree of inflection and compounding. Words often have layered meanings, especially those related to ancestry, tradition, and the landscape. This gives the dialect a sense of formality and structure, and it’s common for words to be descriptive or symbolic, mirroring the Elves’ deep respect for heritage and the natural world.

Names like Selvea, Domiselvea, and Fiumille reflect this tradition. Selvea, for example, conveys the idea of "forest" through a soft, flowing series of sounds, while Domiselvea emphasizes the central, almost sacred quality of the heart of the land. Fiumille, meaning "thousand rivers," retains the complex syllabic structure that reflects both the abundance of natural resources and the intricate weaving of cultural ties. The place name Torroccia highlights the focus on the physical landscape, with a strong, memorable form that evokes images of towering mountains and enduring stone.

Culturally, Steorrian Elvish places great importance on history, lineage, and stability. The language mirrors this through its reverence for traditional forms and its emphasis on words that describe permanence, longevity, and the cycles of the natural world. As such, verbs are often marked for continuity, and nouns tend to denote states of being that reflect endurance. The dialect’s structure and vocabulary feel like an expression of time itself, woven into the very syllables spoken by its people.
