This folder collects in-world prep for the Islands: scenes, missions, dreams, deals, symbols, and other specific story beats that are tied to real people, places, groups, or campaigns.

Use this folder when an idea has “solidified” into something that exists in the world’s tapestry, even if the players have not yet encountered it. Earlier, looser brainstorming and external inspiration can stay in `Ideas/` until it is ready to be promoted here.
