### Convoy Mission Overview

#### **Mission Objective**

The convoy is tasked with transporting crucial supplies to a remote Steorrian settlement in the Jaw, ensuring its survival during a harsh season or period of unrest. The settlement has been left vulnerable due to strained relations between the Selvean government and the Steorrian community, making this mission both vital and politically sensitive.


#### **Convoy Composition**

1. **Supplies**: Includes food, medicine, tools, and other essentials that the settlement lacks.
2. **Guards**: The party is hired to act as protection for the convoy. Their diverse backgrounds and non-Selvean identities make them less likely to draw suspicion from Steorrian settlers who distrust Selvean officials.

#### **Paxitli’s Role**
3. **Selvean Representative**: Paxitli, a high-ranking Appeaser, travels in disguise to oversee the mission and secretly gauge the sentiments of the Steorrian settlers.
- **Reasons for Personal Involvement**:
    
    - **Diplomatic Urgency**: The settlement represents a key opportunity to stabilise relations with Steorrians in the Jaw, and Paxitli believes their personal touch is necessary to make the mission successful.
    - **Distrust of Delegation**: Paxitli is wary of potential corruption or mismanagement by lower-ranking officials.
    - **Cultural Sensitivity**: Their direct involvement could foster trust and better understand the settlers’ grievances.
- **Reasons for Secrecy**:
    
    - **Avoiding Assassination or Kidnapping**: As a high-ranking Appeaser, Paxitli’s presence might attract attacks from factions opposed to their policies, like the Shadow Legion or Steorrian extremists.
    - **Protecting the Mission’s Legitimacy**: Open involvement could alienate Steorrians who view Selvean officials as oppressors, making it harder to secure cooperation.
    - **Maintaining Control in Harboursjaw**: If Paxitli’s absence were widely known, it could spark political manoeuvres or uprisings, particularly from Tzecto’s Shadow Legion.
- **Disguise**:
    - Paxitli adopts a non-binary or fluid identity that blends into the convoy’s ranks, such as a labourer, cleric, or healer. This keeps their involvement inconspicuous while still allowing them to observe and influence events.


#### **Challenges and Stakes**
- **Political Tensions**:
    
    - **Steorrian Settlers’ Distrust**: Many settlers remain resentful of Selvean rule and might reject aid if they suspect ulterior motives.
    - **Factions in the Jaw**: Groups like the Shadow Legion or Steorrian Loyalists could see the convoy as a threat or an opportunity to disrupt peace efforts.
    - **Paxitli’s Disguise**: If their true identity is discovered, it could jeopardise the mission and lead to violence or sabotage.
- **Environmental Threats**:
    
    - Harsh weather, rugged terrain, or natural obstacles may make the journey treacherous.
    - Wildlife or magical creatures tied to the Jaw’s unique ecosystem could pose unexpected dangers.
- **Internal Conflicts**:
    
    - The party’s diverse backgrounds and motivations might lead to clashes or differing priorities during the mission.
    - Suspicion among convoy members could arise if Paxitli’s behaviour doesn’t fully align with their assumed identity.

#### **Potential Encounters**

1. **Steorrian Vanguard Interaction**: A faction of settlers aligned with the Vanguard might test the convoy’s intentions, offering aid or opposition depending on how the party handles negotiations.
2. **Shadow Legion Ambush**: A group of Shadow Legion agents could target the convoy, either to sabotage Selvean goodwill. 
3. **Mystical Jaw Encounter**: An ancient Jaw-related phenomenon, such as a spiritual trial or magical obstacle, might interrupt the journey, providing both danger and opportunity for character growth.

#### **Outcome Implications**

1. **Successful Delivery**:
    
    - The supplies reach the settlement, fostering goodwill and stability.
    - Paxitli gains valuable insight into Steorrian concerns, bolstering their position as an Appeaser.
2. **Partial Success**:
    
    - Supplies are delivered, but not without losses or political fallout.
    - Paxitli’s identity may be compromised, leading to further tensions.
3. **Failure**:
    
    - Supplies are lost, stolen, or rejected, deepening divisions in the Jaw.
    - Paxitli’s mission backfires, potentially costing their political standing or safety.
