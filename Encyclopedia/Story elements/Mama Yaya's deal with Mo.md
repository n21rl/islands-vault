Of course. A temporary price tied to the resolution of the quest is a classic and compelling bargain. It turns the cost into a driving force for the narrative.
Here is the updated recap of Mama Yaya's deal with Mo, reflecting these new conditions.
The Truth of Her Blood 🩸
 * The Offer: Mama Yaya would reveal the full story of Mo's past—the truth of her parents, her birth name, and the shipwreck that left her orphaned. The hole in her memory would be filled.
 * The Price: To learn the story of her parents, Mo must give up the only piece of it she has. She would forget her lullaby completely. The song would be a void in her mind until the day she meets one of her surviving parents, at which point the memory of the melody and its words would return to her.
The Truth of Her Heart 💔
 * The Offer: Mama Yaya would provide the cold, undeniable truth of who murdered Granny Moon, revealing the killer's identity and location. Mo would have the justice she craved.
 * The Price: To be given the truth of the killer, Mo's own ability to deceive would be sacrificed. She would be cursed with a clumsy tongue and an honest face, giving her disadvantage on all Charisma (Deception) checks. This curse would remain until she finally confronts Granny Moon's murderer, at which point her silver tongue would be restored.



The Vision: A Mockingbird's Memory
The world around you dissolves, and your consciousness becomes small, light, and winged. You are perched high above, a mockingbird looking down on the chaos of Harboursjaw. Time itself seems to bend, and the story of the night begins to unspool, told from its brutal end to its conspiratorial beginning.
The Escape ⏪
You see a lone figure fleeing the orphanage, a ghost melting backward into the pandemonium of the distant riot. Their movements are swift, professional, vanishing into the chaos from which they came.
The world rewinds faster. The figure flies backward through the night, landing silently outside the orphanage window. The deep print in the mud vanishes as a heavy Steorrian-made boot lifts from the earth, clean and dry, before being tucked away. The glint of a modified Steorrian coin leaps from the ground into the figure's waiting hand.
The Staged Room ⏪
Inside, the horrific scene reverses itself. The bloody word "TRAITOR" on the wall unmakes its journey, the crimson letters flowing from the plaster back into the figure's fingertip.
The vision sharpens, focusing on Granny Moon. The gash across her chest closes, the river of blood receding back into her body as the hooked point of the Blood Claw is pulled away clean. For a single, heartbreaking moment, she is whole again, sitting up, just before the assassin’s arm snaps back in a fluid, reversed strike. Life leaves her eyes for a second time.
The assassin moves backward through the room, gliding out the window and landing softly on the ground outside, the infiltration undone.
The City in Chaos ⏪
Your vantage point soars higher. Below, the great riot that consumed the city unravels. Shouts turn to whispers, thrown stones fly back into hands, and the brawling crowds of Steorrians and Selveans separate as if pulled by invisible strings. The Champions, who had been struggling to contain the violence, seem to simply fade back to their posts, the emergency un-happening.
You follow the assassin as they move backward through the now-calming streets. They arrive at a hidden alcove and are joined by a small group of "friends." They speak in hushed, reversed tones, their strategic discussion of past events like the Pisswater Inn fire ending as quickly as it began. The conspirators part ways, their plan unmade.
The Bloody Handshake ⏪
You follow the lone assassin further back in time, to a grimy back room where the hulking form of Gristle the orc waits. In a reverse handshake, the assassin places the Blood Claw, its hilt missing the jade eye, back into the gang leader’s hands. Gristle nods, and the assassin walks backward out of the room, their contract unmade, their hands now clean of the weapon.
The Reveal ♨️
The assassin walks backward from their meeting with Gristle, moving with purpose through the pre-riot bustle of Harboursjaw. Your mockingbird's view follows them as they exit the city gates, leaving the stone walls behind for the winding paths that lead into the hills.
The air grows thick with the smell of sulfur and damp earth. You see the figure descend into a ravine shrouded in thick, geothermal steam. They enter a hidden cave mouth, its entrance obscured by the rising vapor.
Inside the secret base, surrounded by the bubbling springs, the transformation happens in reverse. You see the figure, clad in their nondescript Steorrian traveler's clothes, begin to disrobe.
 * The rough-spun tunic is pulled away, and the vision shows them tying the final leather strap of a dark, segmented cuirass worn over thick, quilted cotton armor.
 * The worn boots are removed, and you see them adjusting etched leather greaves over sturdy, jungle-ready sandals.
 * A simple travel cloak is shouldered, and you see them first fastening a dark, woven mantle at their shoulder with a clasp of polished jade.
The vision ends with the chilling, definitive image: the assassin, now revealed in the formidable uniform of a Selvean Champion, standing in the steam of their secret base before donning their disguise to go and meet their underworld contact.
