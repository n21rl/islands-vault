Session Guide: The Battle for the Grand Mound
This guide outlines the battlefield, the key leaders, and the simple mechanics to run a dynamic, three-way battle for control of the Grand Mound.
1. The Goal: Control the Grand Mound
Three factions are vying for control of this sacred and strategic location: the pragmatic Takers, the zealous Maskbearers, and the monstrous Vine-Taken. The party has sided with the Takers in this assault. The first faction to establish dominance wins.
2. The Battlefield: Key Locations
The battle takes place in and around the Grand Mound. The following locations are key points of interest.
Features of the Grand Mound Itself (The Prize):
 * The Summit: The peak of the Mound and the ultimate objective. Controlling it means winning the battle.
* The Root atrium: ground base of m area of the mound, where the party emerges 
 * The Heart: A large area in the mid level the Mound, serving as a vital strategic nexus for cover and movement between levels.

Locations in the Vicinity (The Front Lines):

 * Taker Junk-Fort: A crude defensive camp at the edge of the clearing, serving as the Takers' staging area.
 * Maskbearer Ritual Site: A hastily consecrated clearing where Maskbearer leaders perform rites to bolster their forces.
 * The Spreading Mire: A boggy, vine-choked patch of jungle that serves as the primary emergence point for the Vine-Taken.
 * The Canopy Crossroads: trees with a network of rope bridges connecting to the Mound's middle level, controlling vertical movement on the battlefield.
 * The Drowsy One's Mask: An ancient, overgrown mask embedded near the Mound's foot where the dream-spirit Mama Yaya secretly resides.  

3. The Factions & Their Commanders
Each faction has three key leaders or aspects, each with a unique role.

The Takers (Goal: Plunder and establish dominance)
 * Nemehys (overall leader and strategitst): A goblin woman who leads the main assault.
 * Farra (Veteran Scout): A former Steorrian soldier who uses her tactical skill for ambushes and sniper support.
 * Vael (supporter): A specialist in traps, and medicine, managing supplies to support the forces 

The Maskbearers (Goal: claim the sacred Mound and perform their rites)
 * Split-Tongue (High Priest): A powerful magic-user and the cult's fanatical leader.
 * Petrified (Ritual Coordinator): A support leader who directs the cultists and oversees their rituals.
 * Hollow face (ritual fighter): Their most fearsome warrior. She is currently captured, placing the Maskbearers at a disadvantage.

The Vine-Taken (Goal: Consume, corrupt, and reclaim the Mound for the jungle)
 * The Lashing: The brute force, using massive vines to smash fortifications and entangle foes.
 * The Dreaming: The psychological weapon, releasing clouds of psychoactive spores to confuse and weaken enemies.
 * The Seeding: The source of reinforcements, causing new Vine-Taken to sprout from the dead on the battlefield.

4. The Core Mechanic: The Battle Triangle
This is the simple progress tracker for the entire battle.
 * Draw a Triangle: Label the three corners Takers, Maskbearers, and Vine-Taken.
 * Place a Token: Put a single token (a die, coin, etc.) in the exact center. This represents a stalemate.
 * Movement: The actions of leaders and players will move the token. The closer the token is to a corner, the closer that faction is to victory.

5. The Flow of Battle: Macro-Initiative
The battle proceeds in large, narrative rounds 
 * On a Faction's Turn:
   * Choose one leader from their roster to act.
   * Describe their action at a key location (e.g., "Farra is trying to secure the Canopy Crossroads").
   * Resolve the action with a standard D&D roll (opposed skill check, attack roll, or a check vs. DC).
   * On a success, move the Battle Triangle token one step closer to that faction's corner.

 * On the Players' Turn:
   * The players declare their action. They can engage in a "micro-battle" (using standard combat initiative), sabotage a location, or directly confront an enemy leader.
   * The outcome of their action also moves the token. A victory for the party pushes the token towards the Takers' corner; a defeat pushes it away.

6. Optional Rules for Added Depth
If you want more tactical nuance, you can add these mechanics borrowed from the UA Mass Combat rules.
 * Morale Checks: If a faction's leader is defeated or they lose a critical location (like the Heart), have their remaining leaders make a DC 12 Wisdom Saving Throw. On a failure, that faction loses its next macro-turn as its forces fall into disarray.
 * Tactical Advantage/Disadvantage: Grant advantage or disadvantage on a leader's macro-roll based on the situation. For example, a leader acting from higher ground gets advantage; a leader trying to act in an area filled with spores from the Drowse-Caller has disadvantage.
7. Winning and Losing the Battle
The battle ends the moment the token reaches one of the three corners of the triangle.
 * The faction whose corner the token reaches is declared the victor and takes control of the Grand Mound.
