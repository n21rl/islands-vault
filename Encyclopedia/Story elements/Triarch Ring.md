The Triarch Ring

## Overview

The Triarch Ring is a monumental engineering project undertaken by the Siblíns to bind their three principal islands—[[Áine]], [[Ben]], and [[Cad]]—into a single fortified and unified whole. Through the construction of immense sea walls and causeways spanning the straits between each island, the project seeks to create a protected inner lagoon, expand available land, and symbolically declare mastery over the sea that has long defined Siblín identity.

The three walls, each anchored between a pair of islands, form a vast triangular enclosure enclosing calmer waters where the three straits once met. Each wall contains massive gated locks, capable of opening for trade and navigation or closing during storms to shield the inner basin. The resulting lagoon, known as the Inner Harbour, has become the heart of the Triarch vision—a calm and defensible inland sea surrounded by the walls of Áine, Ben, and Cad.

The Triarch Ring is both a feat of engineering and a political experiment: an attempt to reconcile the guilds’ competing ambitions under a single, city-spanning enterprise.

## Design and Function

Each of the three causeways serves as both bridge and barrier, linking the islands while separating the enclosed inner waters from the outer sea.

### Áine–Ben Wall
The first and most ambitious of the three, built across the narrowest strait via the islet of Cavea. It contains the Grand Lock, a double-gated structure capable of passing deep-draft merchant vessels. This wall forms the main artery of the city’s trade network and the blueprint for later constructions. 

### Ben–Cad Wall
The southern span, designed as an industrial corridor. It houses workshops, cranes, and repair yards along its upper surface. Its reinforced foundation makes it the strongest of the three causeways, but also the most controversial, as it has disrupted local currents and fishing grounds.

### Áine–Cad Wall
The final causeway, known as the Bridge of Unity, was built as a civic and ceremonial promenade, linking the administrative quarter of Áine with Cad’s spiritual district. It is richly ornamented with wards and statues, symbolising harmony between the three islands.

Within the triangle, sluices and floodgates regulate water levels and prevent stagnation, while a network of canals channels runoff from the islands into the lagoon. During storms, the gates can be sealed, transforming the Inner Harbour into a vast safe anchorage.



## Purpose and Ambition

The Triarch Ring serves several intertwined goals:

Land Expansion: The calm waters inside the Ring are slowly being infilled to create new quays, warehouses, and housing in the most crowded districts.

Storm Protection: By enclosing the inner straits, the project provides a bulwark against storm surges and seasonal flooding.

Economic Control: The gates double as customs points, giving the Board leverage over tariffs and trade.

Political Symbolism: The Ring stands as a monument to Siblín unity—three islands bound by stone and ambition.


Yet, beneath these justifications lies a deeper motive: a collective assertion that the Siblíns have tamed the sea, transforming it from a capricious god to a governed machine.

Politics and Controversy

The Triarch Works Commission, formed jointly by the Board and the major guilds, oversees the project. Its funding and contracts are divided among the Builders, Shipwrights, Transporters, and Clockwork Guild, each claiming essential expertise. The Fishers Guild, whose livelihood depends on the open straits, has opposed the plan from the start, citing disrupted currents, dying shoals, and trapped whales.

The project’s immense cost and scale have spurred decades of political wrangling. Rumours persist of corruption within the Board, secret deals for gate monopolies, and smuggling operations using hidden service tunnels beneath the causeways.

The Guildless and poorer districts, displaced by construction, have provided most of the labour, often under brutal conditions. Stories of cave-ins, flooding, and unburied dead circulate quietly among the workforce.

Cultural and Supernatural Dimensions

Public ceremonies mark each closure of the gates, when the sea is symbolically “bound” and blessed by the priests of all three islands. The act is both civic and ritual, reinforcing the Siblíns’ identity as masters of tide and craft.

Not everyone is convinced the sea submits willingly.
Sailors whisper that the deep beneath the Inner Harbour has grown restless since the walls rose, and that the still water hides a pressure that builds with every tide. Cultists of the deep god Tanawhu are said to gather in the drainage tunnels, chanting against the locks that confine their master.

Legacy and Outlook

The Triarch Ring has transformed daily life in the Islands: travel between Áine, Ben, and Cad is now possible on foot or cart, and the inner harbour has become the new economic core of the Siblíns. But the Ring is not yet complete. Its maintenance drains the city’s treasury, and the sea’s slow, ceaseless pressure remains a threat.

To its supporters, it is a marvel—a union of artifice and vision.
To its critics, it is hubris carved in stone.

Whether the Triarch Ring endures or is one day swallowed by the sea will determine not just the fate of the Siblíns, but how history remembers their defiance of the ocean itself.
