Excellent. Those are two deeply personal and potent deals that strike at the very heart of Yasmine's character: her struggle for control over her own nature and her guilt-driven desire for redemption.
Here is a full recap of those two deals, as Mama Yaya would present them.
Deal 1: The Panther's Cage 🐾
This deal addresses a curse tied to a magical panther mask Yasmine possesses. The mask grants her the power to transform, but at a terrible risk of losing herself to the beast within.
 * The Offer: "That mask you wear... it is a cage of tooth and claw, and every time you lock the door, you risk losing the key. You fear, rightly, that one day you will be trapped inside, your mind lost to a hunter's instincts. I can break that lock for you. I will sever the curse's hold. You will never again have to fear that the transformation will become permanent. You will always be able to return to yourself."
 * The Price: "In exchange for this freedom, you will give the leash to me. The curse will no longer be a risk; it will be a tool—mine. I will gain the power to trigger the transformation in you, whenever and wherever I see fit. You will be free from the cage, but you will wear my collar."
Deal 2: The Price of Power ✨
This deal is presented as a sliding scale of temptation, allowing Yasmine to choose just how much of herself she is willing to sacrifice for more magical power, with the ultimate price being a twisted act of redemption.
 * The Offer (A Tiered Bargain):
   * A Taste: "Your power is a flickering candle. Let me feed it a drop of oil. Pledge a small part of your faith to me, and I will grant you new insight." (Mechanic: Take one level of Warlock).
   * A New Path: "The god you serve is silent. My voice is here, and it is real. Abandon the domain that shames you and let my whispers guide you." (Mechanic: Change your Cleric subclass to Trickery, Knowledge, or another suitable domain).
   * A Rebirth: "Why cling to a faith that calls you a heretic? Shed that old skin entirely. Let me remake you. Become my chosen acolyte, and know power you've only dreamed of." (Mechanic: Re-stat your character completely as a Warlock).
 * The Ultimate Offer and Its Price:
   * The Offer: "Or... you can have it all. My full power, a bond like no other. You will be a vessel for my story, a conduit for my will. You will become my new Host."
   * The Price: "And for this final, greatest gift—the price for your complete and total self—I will grant you the one thing your heart truly desires. In exchange for you becoming my vessel, I will resurrect your deceased friend and bring them back to life, whole and hale. Your ultimate sacrifice will be your most selfless reward."
This final tier is the most insidious. It frames the complete loss of her autonomy as the only way for Yasmine to achieve her deepest desire for redemption, forcing her to weigh her own soul against the life of her friend.
