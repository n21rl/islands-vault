Geopolitical Background

The Jaw is a province recently ceded by Steorr to Selvea after a war, between ten to twenty years ago. The Jaw includes the capital, Harboursjaw, and the surrounding region. The province has experienced a heavy Steorrian presence, and there remains tension between the Steorrian settlers and Selvean locals.

Selvean practices such as sacrifice and cannibalism are often misunderstood or viewed as barbaric by the Steorrian.

Cultural Dynamics and Tensions

Selveans are deeply spiritual, believing that life is a cycle of giving and taking, with their religious practices tied to the land and the cosmos. Practices like human sacrifice, cannibalism, and slavery are central to their traditions, but they are rooted in a complex philosophical and spiritual worldview that the Steorrians do not understand.

Human Sacrifice:
For the Selveans, sacrifice is not simply an act of brutality but an essential spiritual offering to maintain balance and cosmic harmony. Chosen or voluntary sacrifices are seen as messengers to the gods, and the act is a revered part of their religious structure, with celestial or agricultural events tied to the practice.

Cannibalism:
Cannibalism is a sacred act reserved for honoring the spirits of great warriors or important individuals. It represents the belief that by consuming part of the deceased, the Selveans preserve their memory and strength. This is not seen as an act of savagery but rather a way of maintaining the bonds between the living and the dead.


Despite this, Selvea’s elites may exploit the system for political gain, selectively using sacrifice  as a way to eliminate rivals or consolidate power. This reveals the underlying hypocrisies in Selvea’s practices, much like the Steorrians’ own contradictions.




Both Selvea and Steorr harbour significant contradictions in their worldviews, which fuel their tension.



Cultural Practices and Clash

The daily lives of people in the Jaw reflect deeper cultural differences between Selvea and Steorr.

Food and Dress:
Selvean cuisine, rooted in communal feasting and local ingredients, would seem extravagant or strange to the more hierarchical Steorrians. Likewise, Selvean clothing, which may emphasize religious symbols or vibrant colors, might be perceived as excessive by the more conservative Steorrian settlers, who value order and propriety.

Relationship with Nature:
The Selveans view the land as sacred, and they practice sustainable agriculture, believing that taking from the land must be balanced by giving back. This spiritual connection to nature contrasts with the Steorrians’ more industrial, expansionist mindset, where they see the land as something to be conquered, cultivated, and exploited.

Art and Expression:
Selvean art is vibrant, symbolic, and deeply tied to religious or ceremonial practices, often depicting gods, myths, and natural elements. Steorrians may find this incomprehensible or primitive, favoring art that glorifies order, law, and the Unwavering Star. The contrasting artistic values serve as another point of contention, with each side critiquing the other’s approach to culture and creativity.


Religion and Syncretism

The Unwavering Star:
Steorrian religion is focused on the Unwavering Star, a deity representing order and authority. Steorrians view their religious practices as morally superior to the Selvean’s perceived barbarism. Steorrian settlers in the Jaw continue to worship the Unwavering Star, imposing their religious beliefs on the local population and viewing Selvean customs as pagan.

Selvean Deities:
The Selveans, with their polytheistic belief system, see the divine in all aspects of nature and cosmic balance. Their deities are linked to the cycles of life, death, and nature. While their rituals may involve sacrifice and other practices alien to Steorrians, they are central to maintaining harmony between the mortal world and the divine.

Syncretism and Religious Tensions:
In an attempt to appease Steorrian settlers or converts, some Selvean rulers may have adopted aspects of Steorrian worship into their own practices, blending the Unwavering Star with their native gods. This syncretism creates tension within Selvean society, as conservative factions might see it as a betrayal of their traditions, while the more pragmatic rulers view it as a necessary adaptation to Steorrian dominance.


Political Intrigue and Power Struggles

Power Struggles in Selvea:
Selvean leaders use their spiritual and cultural traditions for political purposes, often manipulating religious practices to eliminate rivals or consolidate power. Sacrifices could be used to dispose of political enemies, while the social hierarchy, including the institution of slavery, is designed to maintain the elite’s grip on power. This reveals that while Selveans claim to be spiritually superior, their leaders are just as ruthless as the Steorrian colonizers.

Steorrian Colonialism:
While Steorrian rulers in the Jaw claim to bring civilization and order, their colonial practices are exploitative and oppressive. They use the Unwavering Star as justification for their conquests, but they brutally suppress Selvean traditions and exploit the province’s resources. The Steorrians may enforce their own social hierarchies, with Steorrian settlers benefiting from the labor of Selvean subjects, creating further tension.


Conclusion

The province of the Jaw is a culturally rich and politically tense region, with both Selvea and Steorr presenting complex, morally gray societies. Each side views the other’s practices as savage or barbaric, while harboring hypocrisies within their own cultures. Steorrians claim moral superiority through their religion and order, but their violent colonialism reveals their contradictions. The Selveans, meanwhile, balance deep spiritual traditions with pragmatic adaptations to Steorrian dominance, using religion and power in intricate and sometimes hypocritical ways.

This creates a dynamic and nuanced backdrop for storytelling, with layers of cultural, religious, and political conflict in the province of the Jaw.


## Central Conflict
The story unfolds in a politically charged environment between Selvea and Steorr, two neighboring nations with a history of conflict. Recently, tensions have been reignited following the assassination of a Selvean military official who advocated for peace. The power vacuum left by their death has been exploited by a new military officer in the Jaw, who is secretly orchestrating events to escalate tensions and provoke war for personal and nationalistic ambitions.

The central conflict revolves around the officer’s ambition to restart the war with Steorr, which involves:

Inciting Events: The officer may manipulate Steorrian revolts and settler incursions to provoke military responses. This could include framing events to paint Steorr as the aggressor.

Diplomatic Failures: Failed negotiations and border skirmishes create opportunities for the officer to escalate military preparations.

Civil Unrest: Growing dissent within Selvea against another war complicates the officer's plans, as public opinion is divided.

Let's flesh out the factions a bit more. Paxitli acts as the ruler of the Jaw, they're an appeaser. Normally, Selvea doesn't rely on an established army, instead training every citizen for combat. Elite forces called champions are the only "professionals". Because of tensions in the Jaw, the Selvean government sent legions of champions to help Paxitli keep the peace. These are under the command of Tzecto, the military leader intent on stirring conflict to provoke war 

## Key Characters

Selvean Military Officer: The antagonist who manipulates events to incite war. They are driven by personal ambition, ideological zeal, and a desire for glory.

Assassinated Official: The previous leader in the Jaw who favored appeasement, potentially assassinated to make way for the new officer's aggressive strategies.

## Important Events

1. Assassination of the Previous Official: This critical event sets the stage for the power struggle and justifies the officer's subsequent actions to gain control and manipulate the narrative.


2. Border Incidents and Revolts: Small skirmishes and uprisings in Steorr are either instigated by the officer or misrepresented to justify Selvean military action, increasing hostilities between the two nations.


3. Public Protests and Political Maneuvering: In Selvea, protests against war arise, leading to confrontations between pro-war factions and peace advocates. This dynamic introduces moral dilemmas for players who might be caught in the crossfire.


4. Economic Tensions: Resource shortages and trade disruptions, possibly exacerbated by the officer’s actions, create further instability, prompting desperate measures from both sides.


5. Espionage and Deception: The officer employs espionage to carry out false-flag operations, further complicating the political landscape and pushing the nations toward war.
