campaign: "[[A Province on the Edge]]"
---
## Background
 * The Shadow Legion's Plan: The peace-building effort that is [[The Envoy's Convoy]] directly threatens the goals of the Shadow Legion. Their true purpose is to destabilize the Jaw and create conditions where a full-scale war with Steorr becomes inevitable.
 * The Manipulation of the Vanguard: To sabotage the mission, the Legion has manipulated the Steorrian Vanguard in Isernholt. The agent has reframed the convoy's aid as a political weapon, a "leash" to make the Steorrian population dependent and docile. They have goaded the Vanguard into intercepting the convoy, framing it as a patriotic duty to reject Selvean control and prove that "Steorrians provide for their own."

## The roadblock
 * The Setup The Steorrian Vanguard has set up an armed roadblock on the convoy's route to Isernholt. They are presenting themselves not as bandits, but as an organized militia acting on behalf of the "true people of the Jaw."
 * The Declaration As the convoy arrives, the Vanguard leader makes a public declaration. They state they are not thieves but are conducting a "People's Levy." They are "reappropriating" the Selvean goods on behalf of the people of the Jaw to demonstrate their own sovereignty and reject Selvean "charity."
 * The Standoff The Vanguard presents an ultimatum to the convoy's guards: surrender the cargo peacefully or be treated as hostile invaders. This creates a tense, volatile standoff, putting the convoy and its mission in immediate peril.

## Potential Outcomes
The party's intervention is the deciding factor. Depending on their choices, the situation could resolve in several ways, each with different consequences:
 * 1. Violent Escalation If the party or convoy guards choose to fight, a firefight erupts. This is the Shadow Legion's ideal outcome. Bloodshed would create martyrs, frame the Vanguard as terrorists, and give Tzecto the perfect justification to demand a massive military crackdown on Isernholt to "restore order."
 * 2. A Negotiated Compromise The party could successfully de-escalate the violence by brokering a deal, such as allowing the Vanguard to take a "tithe" of the supplies in exchange for passage. This would be politically disastrous for Paxitli, as it legitimizes the Vanguard by forcing a Selvean convoy to pay tribute. The Legion could use this to argue that the Appeaser faction is weak and emboldening their enemies.
 * 3. Successful Deception The party could use illusions or a clever lie to trick the Vanguard into retreating. This would be a clean victory for the party and the convoy. For the Shadow Legion, it's a temporary setback, but they now know the party is a significant obstacle that must be dealt with, and the Vanguard's humiliation could make them more paranoid and easier to manipulate in the future.
 * 4. Surrender of the Goods If the party advises the convoy to surrender the cargo to avoid bloodshed, Paxitli's mission is an utter failure. The Vanguard becomes local heroes by distributing the aid. The Shadow Legion can use this public humiliation to prove the Jaw is ungovernable and that military force is the only solution.
 * 5. Strategic Withdrawal The party might advise the convoy to retreat, recognizing the situation as a political trap. While this avoids a fight and denies the Vanguard a victory, the mission still fails. The Selveans are seen being driven off by a local militia, which reinforces the narrative that Selvean authority is powerless and that the region is unstable.
