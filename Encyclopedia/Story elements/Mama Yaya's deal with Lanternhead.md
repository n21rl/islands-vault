Mama Yaya offers Lanternhead two separate deals. He may accept one, both, or neither.
 * The Deal for the Past: She will reveal the location of his creator and the secret to his undoing.
 * The Deal for the Future: She will reveal the full story of his descendants.
The price for each deal is the loss of magic, to different degrees. 

The Ritual of Forgetting (The Mechanic)
The spells to be lost are determined by a random ritual for each of the three sacrifices.
 * The Roll of Fate: For each spell to be lost, you will roll a d20.
   * On a result of 1-19, the corresponding spell on the master list is targeted.
   * On a Nat 20, it is a twist of fate. No spell is lost for that roll.
The roll corresponds to the following master spell list. 

| Roll (d20) | Spell                      | Level   | Status       |

The Depths of Forgetting (The Core Logic)
The consequences escalate with each repeated roll on the same spell, following the logic of Mama Yaya digging deeper into Lanternhead's being.
 * Tier 1: The Surface (Long-Term Memory): This is the formula inscribed on the glass of the lantern.
 * Tier 2: The Inside (Short-Term Memory): This is the magic currently held actively in his mind, like prepared spells and cantrips.
 * Tier 3: The Depths (The Void): This is the fundamental ability to learn or hold that specific piece of magic.
