While the Star and Dove was waiting for its authorisation to enter Siblín territory, [[Sable Martes]] made her way to the ship. Through her Ring of Scrying, she had been spying on the party and knew their activities weren't always above board. After a shrewd business discussion, they brokered a deal to sell their healing potions through her. 

The party then started planning how they would break [[Calico Jack]] and [[Esmith Wesson]] out of [[Cavea]], based on information obtained from [[Vesper Martini]]. Back for a second visit, Sable revealed that she had planted her ring in the captain's quarter before leaving and eavesdropped on their plan. She offered to help the adventurers infiltrate the prison as cooks or maintenance staff in exchange for a better deal on healing potions and they accepted.

With Sable vouching for them, the adventurers were allowed to enter [[Áine]] and the [[Siblín Guilds]] at large. Disguised as new recruits for the kitchen, they made their way to Cavea, where they faced anti-magic measures and strict security. [[Gurt]] disassembled Godfrey as pets weren't allowed in the prison and waited until he could rebuild him while hiding in the kitchen backroom. [[Rena]] summoned a rat familiar named Merlin and used him to locate Jack and Esmith's cells and sent them a message to prepare for the escape. 

The next evening, the party started a fire in the kitchen and use every mean necessary to make it spread and cause chaos. Adding to the confusion, Gurt had Godfrey run around to distract the guards. The fire grew so much that alarms started blaring and the guards had to evacuate most prisoners to the yard. The party blended in with the crowd and summoned a roc, with the magic token from the sea hag. The gargantuan bird grabbed the party and the two convicts in its claws and took off.

However, the warden rushed out and used a powerful wand to immobilize the roc. Her attempt was thwarted by Rena who managed to counter the spell with her own magic, allowing everyone to fly away. The party instructed the roc to drop them off at a safe location and then fly away in the opposite direction. Back in Áine, [[Yazim]] tracked down [[Lou Beluga]], an old friend from his smuggling days, and asked him to hide Jack and Esmith.
