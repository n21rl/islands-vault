The party made their way into a large room that appeared to be a blend of a distillery and an alchemical lab. A complex network of tubes led from busy workbenches to a large copper still atop a furnace. A few magic items seemed to await processing, while drained ones were destined for disposal. Kaihakan recognised a leak from a waste pipe as the acid the sea elf Aumiha had used. Yazim bottled some up for future use. 

This place was obviously the centre of operations for manufacturing the explosive liquid Gurt had been shown by the kobold Nixt earlier. Research documents and coded messages referred to it as the "Vintage". The party gathered as much evidence as they could, grabbing notes and equipment. 

Kai attempted to collect a sample of the dangerous liquid itself from the filling station. However, his fingers slipped and he dropped the bottle. A loud and low rumble filled the room, as magical force quickly expanded in a devastating explosion, damaging a large area of the lab.  Kaihakan was severely hurt, temporarily blinded and stunned. Also wounded, Yazim supported the impaired Kaihakan as the party rushed to leave, as guards would surely be alerted by the noise. 

As the group entered the mechanical lift, a bell attached to it rang out. Surmising this signalled someone called the lift from upstairs, they quickly developed a plan. Yazim disguised himself as the late Nixt and Rena as a guard. Upstairs, they encountered the gruff dwarven overseer Goldberg with a group of guards. Gurt and Yazim spun a tale that Kaihakan had infiltrated the lab and caused the explosion during a recruitment meeting. After tense negotiations, the party suggested they could dispose of the intruder by feeding him to crocodiles and Goldberg allowed the group to depart.

They went back to the lab below to collect more evidence. Yazim attempted to pick a locker, but to no avail. Kai, having regained his senses, smashed the locker repeatedly and was able to break it open. Inside, they found jewellery, including a signet ring bearing a large W and a small O, most likely Orla Wesson's. Fearing the noise would alert Goldberg and his crew, they decided to flee.  Moving through purple shimmering vapours from the Vintage explosion, they magically turned invisible. Taking advantage of this, they navigated back through the Undercity tunnels from whence they came.

They returned to Esmith, who confirmed that the Eason family had a dislike for her parents and might help take them down. Indeed, they had some political sway and involvement in the major newspaper, the Guilded Gazette. The party visited the press first thing in the morning and met the print master Norimor Eason, who seemed a bit senile. His sister Norimor was colder, but listened to them. After presenting evidence against the Wessons' Vintage operation, the party negotiated a deal. In exchange for her support in exposing the Wessons, Neverins demanded the party handle a crucial matter first: bringing down a pirate operation that was hiding underground in the city and threatened Eason interests.
