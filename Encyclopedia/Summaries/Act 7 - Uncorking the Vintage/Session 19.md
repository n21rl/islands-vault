After their daring prison break, the adventurers noticed that guards were on high alert, carrying frequent stops and occasional searches. They decided to stay a week in Áine to follow the terms of their authorisation and avoid raising suspicion. Lou Beluga was hiding Calico Jack and Esmith in a secret cellar under his inn, the White Straw Hat. Using the inn as a base, the adventurers went to explore the city on their own. 

## Kaihakan
Seeking to practice the art of tattooing, Kaihakan approached Baha, a heavily tattooed whaler captain as she was supervising the unloading of her crew's latest catch. She invited him to join her crew's celebration at The Net Profits tavern. There, she regaled him with whaling stories and offered some whale meat, which he politely refused. Still, she guided him in tattooing a scene on the back of her neck. However, Baha and her crew abruptly fell ill, wrongly accusing Kaihakan of poisoning their meal.

Chaos erupted as the poisoned sailors attacked Kaihakan. He fled through the streets as they chased him and called for guards, but a cloaked sea elf woman grabbed him into an alley. She pressed a blade to his throat, but rather than harm Kaihakan, she ushered him into the sewers to escape. 

Kaihakan realised he had seen the elf earlier, watching the whaling ship from the rooftops. She led Kaihakan through winding underground tunnels to a flooded cave that served as her hideout and introduced herself as Aumiha. She confronted him, questioning his association with whalers. She saw whales as envoys of Savisi'lo, preservers of the peace of the sea and the underworld beyond. Kaihakan defended his faith an culture, that saw Savisi'lo as a tyrannical ruler, Tanawhu as an empowering god and whales as the only reliable food source in the Hakari Isles. 

After a tense conversation, Aumiha explained that she had been sent by her tribe to investigate the whales' migration away from the south of the archipelago. She had witnessed the intensity of whaling by Siblín sailors, and had learned how ambergris from their bellies was used to make perfumes for the rich. Ambergris was the "mana" the Hakari used in their rituals, so this practice seemed sacrilegious to Kaihakan as well. Aumiha revealed she had poisoned the whale meat with a purplish substance she had found leaking from the ceiling of a nearby cave. Their goals temporarily aligned, she asked Kaihakan to help her do the same with ambergris to send a message from the sea elves. 

Kaihakan agreed and used his powers to turn invisible and infiltrate the harbour warehouse indicated by Aumiha. He tricked guards with his summoned tentacle and found the crate of ambergris. Keeping a portion for himself, he tainted the rest of the supply. He reported back to Aumiha, who thanked him and provided him with a crude map to the location of her hideout. This way, should Kaihakan end up in trouble with the authorities, he could put the blame on her. She announced that she would be going back to her tribe and they bid each other farewell.

## Rena
Rena ventured into Áine's famed Eólas Library in search of knowledge. Amidst aisles filled with countless tomes and scrolls, mechanical servants made of metal and wood were carrying out sorting operations. 

Sat in a quiet spot, Rena studied cartography, honing her navigation expertise. Her research also informed her about Siblín society, diverse yet regimented into specialized guilds. In between paragraphs, she kept an eye on the entrance of the "Magic" and "Experimental" restricted sections, where guards were checking visitors' credentials. She noticed automatons carting damaged texts and parts down towards an area marked "Disposal".

After summoning her familiar Merlin in the shape of a spider, she sent him to investigate the restricted sections. He gathered little information before vanishing, first in the magic section after being squashed by a guard, then out of range in the disposal area. 

Taking matters into her own hands, Rena magically morphed into a copy of the librarian automaton. In disguise, she made her way past the guards and down to Disposal. Among the piles of discarded items, she salvaged a old spell book and a damaged scroll. In a deeper cave-like area, she noticed crumbled sections of walls that seem to lead to other underground tunnels but could not get past them. 

Perhaps more intriguingly, she encountered a confused automaton head with shiny blue eyes that addressed her as "User" and offered to answer her queries. Suspicious and running out of time before the library closing time, she kept the interaction brief. She hurried back to the surface and exited Eólas after returning to her usual appearance. 

## Yazim
Yazim had a tough conversation with Esmith, during which she blamed him for abandoning his crew, his family, and her. She told Yazim that the girls of their crew were all executed while she was sent to prison. Yazim apologised, explaining he thought his family would be safer if he left and that he needed time to figure out his best plan of action. 

Reluctantly opening up, Esmith revealed that she had eavesdropped on her parents while she was held in jail before being transferred to Cavea. She heard Erin and Pierce Wesson say they couldn’t risk Esmith bringing any attention to “their plans” and that it would be safer for them to have her imprisoned. She understood her status probably saved her life but her parents decision doomed her to Cavea.

Thinking some of her old contacts could help gather information about her family's secret dealings, she ask Yazim to reach out to Knapper Gall, the elderly gnome that worked for her parents as a cleaner. She knew he used to drink at the Cove Inn in the evening after his shift.

Visiting the location of his family's old bakery and house, he found that it had been turned into a shoe and hat shop. Chatting with the shopkeeper Millie while trying shoes on, he learned that the previous occupiers had left about a year ago and that the current landlady was named Mrs Nocent.

Later in the evening, Yazim went to the Cove Inn to meet with Knapper. In case backup was needed, he brought Lou along but remained evasive about the purpose of the outing. After meeting Knapper, it took Yazim repeated attempts and a bit of magic to get past the nervous, distrustful gnome's defences. Eventually Knapper agreed to help, out of affection for Esmith. He gave Yazim a key that would unlock and disarm magic alarms of Erin's city office, telling him to look for the ledger where Esmith mother kept records of business activities. Knapper pleaded for discretion, urging Yazim to leave no trace of his presence and not remove anything. He told Yazim the key had to be back within two hours when he would leave, so his routine would remain identical to avoid arousing suspicion.

Yazim made his way to the office and spent some time looking for the ledger in the dark, to no avail. After covering the window with thick clothes he had found in a chest, he was able to use a candle without any light being visible from the outside. The candlelight allowed him to find a hidden compartment in Erin's desk. Inside, he found the ledger and started leafing through it. Realising that whine stains on the paper that did not appear random but in fact marking specific entries, he copied the relevant sections of the ledger, before putting the room back in order. Short on time, he ran back to the Cove Inn, where he was able to hand the key to Knapper discreetly.

## Gurt 
Gurt explored Áine on his own, seeking to join a craft guild for additional income. After struggling to locate the Clockwork Guild House, ultimately connected with the small Woodcarvers Guild with which he left an enchanted carved eagle as an application.

Master Carver Madera interviewed Gurt, intrigued by his magical craftwork. Though impressed, she explained that joining a guild in the Siblíns was a commitment akin to becoming a citizen. She also implied that authorities had interest in bird constructs related to a recent crime and said her guild would offer protection, but Gurt feigned ignorance. She cautioned him about aligning with certain groups who would be interested in his abilities.

A few days before the party was to leave Áine, Gurt received a mysterious invitation to meet at the Túram clock tower, joining an exclusive tour led by the half-elf Seraphina. While one of the visitors, a young foreign elf named Tolmiri, was chatting to him, he began experiencing piercing headaches from an unknown source. Creating a smoke effect in response, he caused an evacuation and was intercepted by one of the mechanics from the Clockwork Guild, the kobold Nixt. This was his secret contact. Gurt guardedly followed Nixt to a hidden room of the Undercity. There, the kobold asked him to disassemble a magic pair of boots. Nixt used a device to extract the magic energy from the boots, and condensed into a strange purple liquid, before demonstrating its explosive potential. He promised the artificer vast funds and arcane revelations, trying to secure his membership. Though intrigued, Gurt asked for time before committing and convinced Nixt to give him until the next day.
