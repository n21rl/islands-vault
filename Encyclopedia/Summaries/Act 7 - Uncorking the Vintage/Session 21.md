The party, guided by Yonder, entered a large metal pipe. Walking north, they encountered a metal grate with bars too narrow for most of them to pass through. Gurt, Kai, and Yazim climbed into the Bag of Holding, allowing Rena to carry them through, while she and Yonder squeezed through the bars, being of smaller stature. Suddenly, there was a low rumble ahead and Yonder started running back, warning the party of oncoming rushing water. The entire party was caught in the strong current, pushed backward and battered by debris.

Kai swam back to aid Yonder, while Gurt and Yazim used their Cloak of the Manta Ray and Mariner's Armor to swim against the current. Yazim grabbed onto Godfrey, who anchored them to the rivets in the pipe with his beak. Kai crashed into the grate, shielding Yonder with his body before helping her pass through the bars. He then re-joined Gurt and the two progressed forward together, with Gurt stabbing his dagger into the side of the pipe for support. As the flow of water subsided, the party was shaken and drenched but relatively unscathed. 

They returned to Yonder, who had broken her leg. They healed her and she started opening up to the party. The halfling offered to introduce Kaihakan to Moku, an elderly elf with similar tattoos who also lived in the Undercity. She also urged the party to hire her and her sister Hither in the future. Satisfied they could reach their goal from there, the party bid goodbye to their guide. 

The party continued through the pipe, arriving at the bottom of a large cistern. Yazim peeked inside and, detecting nothing, signalled for his companions to enter. However, the pipe closed up behind them and they were ambushed by a group of guards who were positioned on a walkway surrounding the top of the cistern. Commanding them was the Kobold Nixt who had met Gurt earlier. The dwarf attempted to justify his group's presence, but Nixt ordered the guards to eliminate the adventurers.

As the battle ensued, Nixt used an instrument panel on the wall to manipulate the water levels, hoping to drown his enemies and control the battlefield. This was underestimating the swimming gear and rare skills of the party. Yazim cast spells to make two guards to throw their crossbows and dive into the water, negating their advantage. Kaihakan and his spectral tentacle, Gurt and his mechanical goose fought valiantly, taking down guards one by one. Crocodiles emerged from a pipe and surrounded Yazim, one grabbing him in its jaws. However, he killed them all with a skilful shattering spell. All his allies having died, Nixt turned invisible and tried to escape, but Yazim revealed his presence with a spell, allowing Gurt and Godfrey to finish him off. Using a key found on Nixt's body, the party was able to operate the control panel and open the adjacent door.
