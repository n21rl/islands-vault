Lou Beluga had invited Hildy, a skilled musician originally from Steorr to play at the inn that night. Her beautiful melodies created a festive atmosphere, allowing the group to catch up and share recent discoveries. Piecing together clues, they gathered that the Wessons family was involved in a plot to manufacture destructive weapons from magic items. They decided to investigate the Sunrise winery, navigating through the Undercity to approach stealthily. 

They entered the underground tunnels using the sewer grate that Aumiha had showed Kaihakan. Navigating the perilous passages, the group overheard two strangers arguing about  bringing a woman underground to rob her. One of them seemed reluctant. Gurt recognized the intended victim as Tolmiri, who he had met earlier in the day. The party ambushed the would-be attackers, knocking the more menacing one unconscious. They convinced his companion to stand down. He introduced himself as Fancy and his friend as Fitch. He brought the adventurers to their Haven, where they met the Guildless, an underground community made up of marginalised people who, due to disabilities, criminal records, or other reasons, are excluded from the Sibl√≠n guild system. There, they found a young halfling woman named Yonder who agreed to lead them through the Undercity.

Following Yonder's guidance, they moved through the winding tunnels. When traversing catacombs, she warned them to carefully avoid disturbing old bones and awakening their spirits. They distracted a disoriented patrol, leading the guards away with an illusion. After neutralizing the squad leader, they were closer than ever from the winery's cellar.
