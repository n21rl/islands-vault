The party met on the main harbour of [[Star Point]], a major Steorrian city on the [[Grand Isle]]. Along with a young halfling named [[Bob]], they were hired to join the crew of Captain [[Orguk]]. The orc worked for the half-elf merchant [[Hugh Bowes]], who had been travelling with a [[Steorrian army]] escort, including the elven sergeant [[Elysia]]. The adventurers met [[Cook]], the Goliath cook and [[Kawrl]], the birdfolk lookout.

Shortly after setting sail towards the Sibl√≠n Islands, fed up with taking orders from Bowes, Orguk convinced the new hires to join him and his crew in taking control of the ship and its secret cargo. During the battle that ensued, the ship was attacked and destroyed by a sea monster.
