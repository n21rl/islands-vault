The party devised a plan to rescue [[Bob]] and flee the island. Using grease, [[Gurt]] managed to lower the chain that was blocking the ship. [[Yazim|Brenlinn]] tricked the merchant's team to approach the fort. [[Kaihakan]] fired a ballista bolt, killing the elven sergeant who seemed the biggest threat. The party, Bob, and the 4 other members of [[Crew]] escaped the island aboard the ship, leaving Bowes and his men stranded. 
The crew sailed for a few days and encountered a shimmering fog imbued with strange magical effects. Gurt aged down by about a year after traversing the fog. During the voyage, Brenlinn figured out that the cloak would help swim and breath underwater. While praying to his god, Kaihakan was grabbed by a watery tentacle, which awakened powers in him.
