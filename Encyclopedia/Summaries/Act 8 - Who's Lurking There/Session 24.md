Hoping to leave √Åine soon, the party set out to tie some loose ends. Yazim hired an investigator though Lou in order to help track down his family. The party met with Sable to sell more of their Green Salt potions. Although she was displeased they had allied with the Easons rather than her, she offered to use her connections to bypass the mandatory ship inspection, allowing Calico and Esmith to escape undetected. She requested a hefty payment in exchange however, so they declined, deciding to rely on Gurt's plan with the Bag of Holding instead.
 
As they made their way through the city, the party was ambushed by a gang of sailors led by Baha, who still held Kai responsible for the whale meat poisoning. The party swiftly dispatched the whalers, with Kai killing Baha and intimidating her second in command into submission. 

Following this encounter, the party delved deeper into the Undercity than ever before, navigating its dark and treacherous tunnels. Armed with a map provided by the Guildless, they sought out the enigmatic sea elf named Moku. Their journey led them to three aspiring Tanawhu cultists, who turned out to be directionless Guildless elves taken under Moku's wing. Kai's charisma and connection to Tanawhu swayed the elves to his side.

At last, they came face to face with the elusive sea elf, whose full name was Mokunaro. His reception was far from warm, as he was dismissive and insulting towards, rejecting the validity of his adoption by Kahwra and asserting himself as the last true Hakari. Kai, in a bold move to prove his divine connection, summoned his spectral tentacle. This display shifted Mokunaro's perspective dramatically. He began to see Kai as the potential champion of Tanawhu, fulfilling the prophecy from his dreams. In light of this revelation, Mokunaro requested to join Kai on his journey, offering to serve as a guide in the adventures to come.
