The party ventured once again into the Undercity, following the directions provided by the Easons. Their journey took them through various storage areas and unexpectedly onto the street, where they awkwardly improvised excuses to explain their presence to suspicious guards.

Upon reaching the alleged pirate hideout, they encountered a group of young individuals who fled at their approach. The chase that ensued took a dangerous turn when the fleeing group released dangerous slimes, causing chaos and tragically claiming the life of one of their own. As the situation escalated, the group realized the party's intentions were not hostile. They revealed the slimes' weakness to water. Seizing the opportunity, Kaihakan retrieved the flying dinghy from their bag of holding, using it to release a torrent of water upon the slimes. This clever tactic effectively neutralized the threat and brought the conflict to an end.

In the aftermath, the truth came to light. These supposed pirates were, in fact, Guildless youth operating a clandestine printing and manuscript copying operation to spread knowledge among their community. The party decided to spare the youth but demanded they cease their operations, at least in this location. Recognizing the limited opportunities available to the Guildless in Áine, they suggested they might find better prospects in the Republic. They recovered stolen books, as wells as tools, including a rudimentary printing press. They also found an intriguing android head under piles of parchments.

With their mission accomplished, the party returned to Neverins Eason to report their findings and surrender the goods, with the exception of the mechanical head. This meeting solidified their agreement. The Easons would help to expose the Wessons' illicit activities and grand the party Guild membership, a status that could become official in two weeks. However, the party decided to take part in the following ceremony in seven weeks instead. They wanted to leave Áine quickly but had a few matters to take care of before.
