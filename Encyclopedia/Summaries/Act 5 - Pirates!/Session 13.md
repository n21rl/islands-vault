As the eerie song echoed across the waters, no distinct source for the voice could be perceived. A pale figure of a banshee floated on the surface of the sea, menacingly approaching the party's ship. Mr. Fleming unexpectedly advised the Asteroidea's crew to surrender to the pirates before retreating below deck. Cannon fire erupted as both ships demonstrated clever manoeuvring. The pirate ship was heavily damaged, but managed to get close enough to allow its crew to board the adventurer's vessel.

The adventurers found themselves engaged in a fierce and chaotic battle with the pirates. They faced off against bare-chested  twins who fought unarmed with unmatched agility and strength. Godfrey, delivered a decisive blow, killing one of them. A elven lady clad in tight black leather wielded a whip with dangerous precision, ensnaring opponents and pulling them closer. A woman wrapped in a large cloak, displayed surprising resistance to weapon blows despite her lack of obvious armour. To his surprise, when Kai attempted to submerge her underwater, she defied expectations and did not drown. From a small rowboat, two other pirates climbed aboard the ship. One of them was a red dragonborn armed with powerful guns. The other was a human with a powerful voice infused with magic and a distinct lack of teeth. The party surmised he was the captain and the main singer of the intimidating song and. The banshee vanished when he was hit, revealing it as one of his illusions. 

Just as victory seemed within the adventurers' grasp, a sudden explosion erupted beneath the deck, sending shockwaves through the ship. In a fit of fury, Gurt hurled a cannonball assisted with magic at the already heavily damaged pirate ship, dealing a devastating blow and causing it to start sinking further. 
Amidst the chaos, Mr. Flemming emerged from below deck, with a face covered in soot and a noticeably different accent, raising suspicions about his true identity and intentions. 

As the battle raged on, the elf clad in leather was wounded and ran below deck. Later, she inexplicably returned in significantly better health and engaged in a duel with Brenlinn. She suddenly recognized him and addressed him as Yazim, revealing a past connection from their time at Bard College. The elf introduced herself as Angela, now going by the  nickname Flogging Molly due to her skills with the whip. She proceeded to introduce the main members of her crew going as [[The Bards]]: Captain Wayne MacGoshan, [[Tin Lizzie]] the undrownable mechanical woman, the twins [[Liam Murphy]] and [[Noel Murphy]] (now dead) known as the Dropkick Murphys, [[Red Rum Jack]] the dragonborn. [[Vesper Martini]] shed the identity of Mr Fleming and revealed they were actually a spy for a pirate crew allied with the Bards. These introductions indicated the potential for an unexpected alliance and further revelations to come.
