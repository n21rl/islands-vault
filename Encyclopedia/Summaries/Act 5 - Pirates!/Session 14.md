After the end of the battle, the [[Adventurers|party]] discovered [[Brother Uriel]], a young evangelist from the [[Church of the Unwavering Star]], chained up under the deck of the pirate ship. [[The Bards]] had captured him while he was evangelizing in the [[Northern Scattered Isles]] and forced him to heal them with his divine power. The adventurers refused to exploit his magic but also didn't argue in his favour. The pirates swore they would ransom him back to [[Mission]]. The party also deliberated on the fate of the [[Steorrian army|Steorrian soldiers]] that had been sent on the expedition with them, ultimately deciding to ransom them back to [[Steorr]].

Using codewords, [[Vesper Martini]] said they were working for the 'M' of the 'MI6', which the Bards explained was referring to [[Captain Morgan]] of the [[The Drunks]]. The pirates were involved in estbalishing a [[Republic|Republic]] based on the island of [[New Destiny]], forging a path of freedom independant from the main powers of the the Islands. They were in the process of developping a [[Pirate Code|Code]] to govern the new country. One important of this Code was crews chosing their captains that would form a council to make decisions for the Republic. Two of these captains were [[Wayne MacGoshan|Wayne]] and [[Captain Morgan|Morgan]].

The most recent addition to the council turned out to be [[Orguk]], who captained the party's ship until it was attacked by a sea monster. He had provided the pirates with valuable information: Steorrian ships in the region, especilly linked with the Green Salt Trading Company, had been secretely transporting magic items. This proved to be a precious bounty for the Repuplic and was the reason behind the recent attacks. Orguk was sometimes ridiculed within the Republic for his lack of ship and crew.

The party also learned that [[Calico Jack]], another captain of the Republic, was currently a captive on Cavea, a Siblín prison island situated between [[Áine]] and Ben. [[Yazim]] knew that Esmith, his childhood friend and former smuggling partner, was also held there.

Wayne and Molly attempted to persuade the adventurers to become part of the Republic. Wayne employed his magical abilities to influence their decision but they refused. However, they saw that their interests could align. The Bards offered to carry out repairs on New Destiny and the party agreed to tow the pirates' ship there. The party therefore set sail towards the Republic, their mind brimming with a mix of caution and excitement.
