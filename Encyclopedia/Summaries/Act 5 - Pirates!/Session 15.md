After arriving to [[New Destiny]], the [[Adventurers|party]] visited [[Shops of the Republic v1|shops]] and acquired several items. [[Kaihakan|Kai]] bought an enchanted shield and [[Rena]] a red stone, similar to her own green one. [[Yazim]] managed to sell some Green Salt healing potions to the apothecary miscellaneous for a good price.

In the evening, the party attended [[Noel Murphy]]'s Wake, where [[Wayne MacGoshan|Wayne]] delivered a heartfelt eulogy. Music, drinking and games created a festive atmosphere. However, tensions arose when [[Liam Murphy|Liam]] attacked Godfrey for killing his brother. [[Tin Lizzie]] stepped in to protect Godfrey. Drunk bystanders were caught in the crossfire, resulting in a full-scale choatic bar brawl with a fire erupting and objects being thrown. Wayne interrupted the fight before anyone was too badly hurt and the festivities resume.

The next morning, the adventurers visited the Auction House, where the goblin [[Xander]] identified Sable's ring as a scrying device. Yazim realised he may have been spied on every time the ring was outside bag of holding. Among the items on auction, Rena recognized an alchemy jug that her previous crew had stolen from [[Northern Scattered Isles]] natives in the past but kept silent. During the auction, the adventurers aquired a pair of magical conches that allowed for remote communication and sold off the eggs they got from the hag.

At the shipyard, the party made arrangements at the shipyard to repair their vessel, ensuring it was ready for upcoming challenges. They also planned for major cosmetic changes, to make it unrecognisable. They changed the figurehead and renamed it The Star and Dove. [[Muni]] asked for a raise for [[Crew]] which the adventurers granted. They said their goodbyes to Liv would take the next ship heading towards Otarky.

Kaihakan walked the long suspended bridge leading to the Priestless Temple, located on a rock battered by the waves. There, he found an interesting collection of idols and carvings, dedicated to the worship of many gods. In front of an old carving of a squid reminiscent of his own Tanawhu, he found [[Orguk]] praying. The orc recounted his journey, how he grabbed onto a tentacle when the ship was sinking and how he eventually found his way to Eleuthera where he encountered Wayne's crew. A changed man, he now worshipped the Squid, viewing it as a symbol of endurance in the face of adversity. He was interested in learning more about Tanawhu from Kaihakan.

[[Gurt]] and Rena conducted experiments with the mysterious red stone. They discovered it responded strongly to elemental magic.

From the Molly and Wayne, Yazim learned of the various missions presented by the Republic: capturing an armored ship for defense, finding Elizabeth Grey to have her join the Republic, raiding Steorrian ships for magic items, freeing Calico Jack, exchanging prisoners for ransom. Orguk was also interested tracking down the shipwreck of the Arrow as magic items were probably still there. The party decided to follow this lead, figuring that the treasure would make the orc less likely to try and steal their ship and crew.
