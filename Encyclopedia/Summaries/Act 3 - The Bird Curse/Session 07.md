As thanks for crippling the smugglers' operation, the [[Adventurers|party]] received a flag of [[Otarky]] and mushroom cloth to sell north of the island. They transported [[Liv]], who had been asked for help by a merchant from the northern town. As they approached the town, they noticed a massive shape sink under water in the distance. 

On the harbour, an argument was ongoing between [[Sable Martes]], a merchant woman from the Sibl√≠n Guilds and the harbourmaster. Sable's sails had been torn to shreds by a flock of birds after her ship nearly got stuck in a mass of sargassum. The man was refusing to sell cloth to Sable, as trade had been poor in the area and the town inhabitants favoured the needs of their own ships. The party offered to sell their textile to Sable for a premium, which she accepted. Sable tried to learn of any trading opportunity from the adventurers, promising them shares in her new ventures, but they kept quiet. [[Yazim|Brenlinn]] deftly stole a ring from Sable's finger. 

Suddenly, a young boy was attacked by swarms of gulls on the pier. The party protected him and learned that he was named [[Ham]]. He told them that his friends and him had found a large egg in the mushroom swamps after it fell out of the sky. Since, birds had been acting violently around town, going after children in particular. The adventurers went around town to look for [[Fipp]], Ham's friend who was currently in possession of the egg. They were unable to find him. Liv revealed that she could communicate with animals, and that a lone starling had told her a mysterious phrase: "Fetid blubber, seaweed, close the eye, set us free". 

The group met [[Master Powell]], an eccentric old man fascinated by lore and magic. His collection of magic items had recently been stolen and he suspected a group of Steorrians was responsible. He bought items, books, and even stories from the party. He did not have any obvious information to offer about the bird attacks.

During the night, the adventurers were woken up by a loud commotion. They found that a man had been murdered. His body was strangely mutilated, with marks from antlers, claws and fangs. His chest was ripped open, and his heart was missing. The house had been ransacked and large blue feathers littered the floor. A young girl was found hiding in a chest of drawers. It was [[Telmay]], Ham's friends who had been keeping the egg the day before Fipp. She had been staying with her uncle, the murdered man, as her parents were trading south. Telmay told the party she saw two large human shadows and heard two people talking as if they were a couple. They were looking for the egg. The woman told the man to look for her in the East, where the seabirds gather. The party ran to Master Powell's house with the clues they had found. The loremaster told them he would need the rest of the night to find relevant information in his large library.
