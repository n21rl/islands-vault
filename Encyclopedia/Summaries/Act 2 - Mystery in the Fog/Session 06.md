[[Viktor]] had interrogated the captured smugglers and learned that the other half of gang operated from a ship that only approached in foggy weather. [[Gurt]] gathered that Viktor had killed [[Marius]] as revenge for his brother's life, but kept the secret. The hideout was empty when the party returned to the house.

Lanterns signals were sent form the house to the smugglers' ship when it was spotted, to make it drop anchor. [[Gurt]] and [[Yazim|Brenlinn]] pretended to be members of the gang bringing merchandise aboard with a small rowboat. Approaching discreetly through the fog on the party's ship, [[Kaihakan]] jumped aboard to fight the smugglers. Gurt and Brenlinn managed to maintain the illusion for a while, taking down bandits with Kaihakan. Ultimately, they felt outmatched and decided to flee and sail back to town. As they were leaving, Gurt noticed the leader of the smugglers was a gnome woman he identified as [[Elisabeth Grey|Captain Grey]], who he had sailed under years and years ago. She however did not seem much older.
