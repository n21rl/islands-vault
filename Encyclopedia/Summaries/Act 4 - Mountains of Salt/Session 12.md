The adventurers found themselves faced with a formidable opponent: a green salt giant. A tough fight ensued, with the towering monster using his powerful fists and throwing sharp shards off its body towards distant opponents. As the battle raged on, Rena's stone she kept hidden under her clothes began to vibrate, resonating with the elemental magic possessed by the giant. Eventually, the party managed to defeat the colossal creature. It exploded, causing the chamber to start collapsing. The adventurers grabbed a substantial amount of green salt and escaped through the crumbling exit tunnel. 

They said their goodbyes to Parker, who gave them his old shoes, as thanks for eliminating the source of noise in the back of his cave. In return, Brenlinn gave him his magical laughing fish head. Later, upon inspecting the footwear, Gurt realised it would allow the wearer climb surfaces like a spider. He also discovered the name "Parker Peter" inscribed on a small label inside. 

On their way back toward town, they passed the mine once again. There, they met Alex, the Goliath miner depicted on the propaganda posters in town. He was injured and alone, the guards having gone into the mine to help clear the cave-in that wounded him. He refused to consume the green salt, claiming that guards could detect it with their pendulums. The party healed Alex and asked him a few questions about his background. They gathered that he probably had been captured as a child, based on their talks with with the mountain tribe. Surprisingly, Alex seemed content with his life in the mine. In case he ever became curious enough to go meet his kin, Gurt gave him a singing carved bird just like the one he had given the tribe. 

Back in Sealtham, Rena stumbled upon Bob, who was indulging in some dreamleaf he had acquired from a stranger. In exchange for the intoxicating substance, Bob said he had pointed to the location of Otarky on a map. The party gathered the mysterious man was probably the merchant who had asked about the provenance of the shroomwood. Meanwhile, Brenlinn attempted to sell the ring he stole off Sable to Lord Mayor Brummb채r. The dwarf was the local authority and a person of influence within the [[Green Salt Trading Company]]. As the the only person of means around, he was the most likely customer for the ring. However, Brenlinn's efforts were repeatedly dismissed by the busy man
Curiosity led Kai to conjure magic and make himself invisible in order to eavesdrop on Brummb채r, who was engaged in a discussion with a dishevelled half-elf. The name of Orguk, the previous captain of the party, came up in conversation as well as mentions of stolen cargo and pirates. 

Thanks to Muni backing Kaihakan's earlier lies, the party obtained the paperwork that made them appear as legitimate members of the Green Salt Trading Company. However, this meant that they were now subjects to the requisition order issued by Lord Mayor Brummb채r.  Along with two other ships, The Asteroidea was to be sent on a mission to hunt pirates in the Scattered Isles. The pirates had been attacking Sterorrian ships and Brummb채r claimed the Crown wouldn't come to the the aid of the Green Salt Trading Company and the people of Sealtham. An elegant elven man named Mr. Fleming was assigned to oversee the operations aboard the Asteroidea, due to his knowledge of the Scattered Isles and his ties to the Company. The party finally recognised the Lord Mayor's scruffy guest as Hugh Bowes, who apparently managed to escape the island they abandoned him on. Thankfully, they were disguised and he did not seem to recognise them. 

Seeing no other option, the crew departed on their new assignment. Zak remained in Sealtham in search of other opportunities. Kai set about constructing a shrine room beneath the ship's hull. On the way to the objective, the ship briefly stopped an island named Mission. The abbot of the [[Church of the Unwavering Star|Unwavering Star]] monastery granted an audience to the adventurers and asked them for a large donation, which they refused.

After weeks of sailing, approaching the supposed location of the pirate hideout, the three ships separated to cover a larger search area. One night, the crew of the Asteroidea heard a haunting song resonating through the air. Amidst the darkness, the silhouette of a menacing pirate ship emerged. The party braced themselves, their hearts pounding with anticipation as they prepared for an imminent confrontation.
