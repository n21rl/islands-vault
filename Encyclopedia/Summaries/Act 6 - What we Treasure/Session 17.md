While the crate was in its reduced state, the party managed to break it open and discovered a vast amounts of magic items inside. With these treasures, [[Orguk]] would have enough to buy a ship, and the party made a substantial profit of roughly 5000 gp. Each member of the party kept a magic item and a trinket of their choice, while the remaining items were prepared for sale at the auction house. The crate also contained an entry document to the Siblíns prepared by [[Hugh Bowes]].

As they were managing the loot, the adventurers heard some commotion on the deck. The man they had met on the floating wreck of the Arrow had made his way to the ship and was attacking members of the crew. With a gaping mouth and unmoving lips, he screamed in a high-pitch voice that they had destroyed his ship so he would take theirs. With deadly efficiency, the adventurers killed him before he could land a single attack. Examining his body, they noticed he was missing his tongue and found a mysterious note.

The Star and Dove made its way back to [[Republic]], where [[Gurt]] and [[Yazim]] sought out [[Inkbeard]] to acquire magical tattoes. [[Kaihakan]] followed as he was interested in the process. However, he was kicked out after critizing the tackiness of the designs. With the aid of invisibility, he snuck back in to observe. However, [[Inkbeard]] heard him and angrily refused to finish Yazim's tatttoo before Kai left and and extra charge was paid.

In New Destiny, the talk of the town was split about inviting [[Elisabeth Grey]] to join the Republic. [[Captain Morgan]] and his followers saw her as a potentially powerful pirate ally while [[The Bards]] and others feared she might corrupt the young Republic, due to her indiscriminate attacks on civilians of the Northern Scattered Isles. The party also thought she would be a bad influence, but differed on what approach to take. [[Wayne MacGoshan|Wayne]] wanted to seek her out and kill her, while Gurt preferred to avoid direct confrontation. The party decided to tarnish Grey's reputation in the Republic, spreading rumours about her, starting with the watering hole frequented by [[The Sea Dogs]].

The party decided to set sail towards the Siblín Guilds, planning a prison break. They hoped to free Calico Jack for the Republic, and Esmith for Yazim. They would use information provided by Vesper about the prison island of Cavea. After facing a storm, they made it to the Áine harbour. However, they lacked a vouching contact required to gain entry to the Siblíns. Through officials, they sent a message to [[Sable Martes]] along with her ring, hoping she would vouch for them. As a backup plan, Gurt also carved a lifelike falcon figurine to apply to join the Woodcarvers Guild.
