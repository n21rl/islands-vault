The [[Adventurers|party]] learned that the Arrow had been spotted still floating despite the sea monster attack. [[Orguk]] hoped to retake the ship for himself if it was still in sailing condition. He therefore hired a crew of five, opening a line of credit with the party to afford wages. Even if it was impossible to claim the ship, Orguk knew it probably still held treasures in its hold. The orc agreed that any loot above the value of a sloop (7000 gp) would go to the adventurers and their crew.

The party managed to sail to the Arrow and noticed it was severely damaged but seemingly held together by seaweed and barnacles. [[Rena]] remained on the Star and Dove to study, while the rest of the party went to board the Arrow with Orguk. The party explored the ship and soon found themselves in a fierce battle with the monstrous crustacean creatures that inhabited the ship, hiding amongst rubble and seaweed. During their exploration, they discovered a locked crate chained up in hold. Detaching it from the wall was easy enough but they could not best the lock on the crate itself.

As they were about to retreat to the Star and Dove, the ship was suddenly ensnared by massive tentacles, trapping them in a perilous situation. [[Yazim]], used his magic to reduce the size of the crate, allowing it to fit on the flying rowboat with Orguk, who was able to navigate the rumbling ship to escape. The adventurers made their way back onto the deck, dodging tentacles, crumbling planks, and fleeing crustaceans. On their way out, a strange man with a high-pitch voice holding a staff topped with a crab pincer screamed at them to leave his ship alone. They ignored him, continuing their escape. Gurt using his magical technology, swam away at high speed, followed by Yazim.

Before leaving, [[Kaihakan|Kai]] swam underwater to get a look at the giant octopus responsible the chaos. To his surprise, the creature reached out and touched Kai's forehead with a tentacle, conveying a message: "When the time comes, you will come free me." Kai rejoined his companions before the monster had a chance to change its mind and attack him instead of the Arrow, which was now colllapsing into the sea.
