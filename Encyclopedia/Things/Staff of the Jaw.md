The Staff of the Woodlands

Overview

The Staff of the Woodlands is an ancient magical artifact recovered by Bryn, a long-time friend of Granny Moon. It is not merely a powerful druidic implement—it carries deep symbolic and political weight.

Description

It is an old Staff of the Woodlands once wielded by a unifying leader of the Jawist peoples, suggesting a historical era when the clans of the Jaw stood together.



Bryn’s Intentions

Bryn believed that the staff could become a rallying symbol for the disparate native peoples of the Jaw.

His hope was to promote a “third path”—a political and cultural alternative to both Steorrian colonialism and Selvean domination.

The staff was meant to revitalize Jawist identity and unify those disillusioned with outside rulers.

Granny Moon was traveling to Isernholt to meet Bryn and help him launch this unifying movement when she was assassinated by the Shadow Legion.

Importantly, the Shadow Legion did not know about the staff or Bryn’s mission. They killed Granny Moon simply to eliminate a symbol of compromise and diplomacy, further deepening tensions between factions.


Wants the Staff of the Woodlands to have already been stolen from Bryn. It is now part of a larger Steorrian shipment of cultural artifacts leaving from New Bæcon for the Old Lands, which is accepted within Steorr but controversial in the Jaw. The party may need to recover it before it is exported. The operation is not a secret in Steorr but becomes politically fraught when crossing out of the Jaw. The staff could also tie into the minor magic item plot.







What if staff is stolen from Brynn, part of a large Steorrian booty of stolen or dodgily acquired native items that are to be sent to the Old Lands to a museum or something like that? 

That's a potent and thematically rich twist. Here’s how it could unfold and tie into your campaign:

The Theft of the Staff of the Woodlands

Premise

Bryn’s recovered Staff of the Woodlands is stolen, not just as a personal betrayal but as part of a larger operation—a covert Steorrian effort to confiscate, purchase under duress, or outright steal cultural artifacts from the Jaw and ship them to the Old Lands under the guise of “preservation” or “academic study.”

This aligns with historical colonial patterns and drives political tension between factions.

Key Elements to Include

1. The Booty Shipment

A Steorrian convoy or galleon is preparing to leave from a major port (e.g., Harboursjaw or New Bæcon), loaded with artifacts: sacred masks, ceremonial weapons, ancestral bones, herbal lore tomes, etc.

These items are “donated,” “purchased,” or “recovered” with shady paperwork, many stolen or acquired under duress.

The Staff of the Woodlands is not listed in the manifest—it is part of a sealed crate marked for a private donor or “special transfer.”


2. Who Stole It and Why

The theft could have been done by:

Steorrian Loyalists trying to remove a potential Jawist unifying symbol.

A Selvean double agent aiming to discredit Bryn or incite unrest.

A museum agent from Steorr (noble patron, collector, scholar) who knew the staff's history and wanted it “saved.”

Someone bribed by the Shadow Legion, unaware of its true importance.



3. What Happens to Bryn

Bryn is left injured or imprisoned—discredited as a “smuggler” or “delusional rebel.”

Alternatively, he disappears under mysterious circumstances—possibly on the run, or actively trying to reclaim the stolen items.

His reputation is under attack: Steorrian papers spin the staff as "looted from a government dig," casting Bryn as a thief.

Plot Hooks and Player Options

A. Interception

The party can learn about the staff’s presence in the cargo through Paxitli, a Jawist informant, or even through Yasmine’s healer network.

A heist or sabotage mission against the convoy before it sets sail could become a dramatic centerpiece.

Multiple factions might try to claim it: Selveans, Loyalists, Jawists, even criminal gangs like the Hammer.


B. Public Reckoning

Players could expose the artifact heist to stir political unrest—turning public sentiment against Steorrian authorities.

The discovery of records or personal letters in the crates might show systemic abuse and theft, giving Jawists and Autonomists ammunition.


C. Museum Showdown

If the staff reaches the Old Lands, a future arc could involve infiltrating a Steorrian museum or embassy where it’s displayed in a private collection.

Imagine an exhibit titled “Mystic Artifacts of the Jaw: A Vanishing Culture”—complete with sanitized narratives and misattributed labels.

Thematic Impact

This arc deepens existing tensions around:

Cultural theft and erasure

Colonial narratives and revisionism

The clash between preservation and possession


It also raises a powerful moral dilemma: What does it mean to recover a sacred object, and who has the right to decide its fate?
