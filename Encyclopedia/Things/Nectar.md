The Nectar is a high-status Selvean beverage made from fermented fruit, flowers, and plant materials. It is reserved for high-ranking members of Selvean society and Champions. The drink has both **non-alcoholic and alcoholic** variations, with a preparation process that neutralizes the natural sedative properties of one of its key ingredients, the **Selvean Bluestar** flower. Elves have a natural resistance to its effects, but non-elves must consume properly processed versions to avoid intoxication or unconsciousness.



#### **Ingredients**

The Nectar is composed of carefully selected plants and fruits, each contributing to its distinct properties:

- **Selvean Bluestar (Amsonia caelora)** – A deep blue, star-shaped flower that contains natural sedative compounds. When consumed raw, it causes drowsiness, hallucinations, or loss of consciousness in non-elves. Fermentation or heat neutralizes these effects.
- **Sun-Touched Agave** – A hardy, drought-resistant plant that provides natural sugars and a thick texture. It is essential for fermentation and balances the bitterness of Bluestar.
- **Golden Guava** – A fragrant fruit that enhances sweetness and adds a floral undertone.
- **Tamarind Pod** – Provides a tart contrast to the other ingredients, improving balance.
- **Jade Citrus Leaves** – Occasionally added to certain variants for a slight bitterness and additional aromatic depth.
- **Wild Yeast Strains** – Naturally occurring fermentation agents, with cultivated strains used in premium batches.



#### **Preparation Process**

The Nectar’s production follows a controlled method to ensure both **safety and quality**:

1. **Harvesting & Sorting** – Bluestar flowers must be picked at dawn, when their potency is at its lowest. Fruits and agave are selected at peak ripeness.
2. **Initial Processing**
    - **Agave is pressed** to extract syrup.
    - **Fruits are crushed** and combined.
    - **Bluestar is either fermented or boiled** to neutralize its sedative properties.
3. **Fermentation & Aging**
    - The mixture is placed in **clay or wooden vessels** to ferment naturally.
    - Fermentation time varies based on the variant:
        - **Dawn Nectar (Non-Alcoholic)** ferments for 5–7 days.
        - **Dusk Nectar (Alcoholic)** undergoes long fermentation (weeks to months).
4. **Final Refinement**
    - The liquid is strained to remove plant residue.
    - Some batches undergo **secondary aging** in sealed containers.
5. **Storage & Serving**
    - Stored in **ceramic vessels** or **lacquered wooden flasks**.
    - Served in **communal bowls** during ceremonies.


#### **Cultural Views & Usage**

- **Symbol of Status** – The Nectar is exclusive to Selvean elites. Being offered a cup signifies deep respect.
- **Ceremonial Use** – It is consumed at **victory feasts, coronations, and seasonal celebrations**.
- **Communal Drinking** – The drink is passed in a **structured order**, following rank and contribution.
- **Non-Elf Restrictions** – Raw Bluestar can be dangerous to non-elves. **Only prepared versions** are permitted for outsiders.



#### **Variations**

- **Dawn Nectar** – Mildly fermented, non-alcoholic, often used in diplomacy.
- **Dusk Nectar** – Fully fermented and alcoholic, reserved for **Champions and high-ranking officials**.
- **Regional Blends** – Some variations include extra herbs, spices, or aging techniques.
