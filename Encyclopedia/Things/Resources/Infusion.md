Botanical Description

1. Plant Name:
Choose a name that reflects the culture of the Islands or the colonizers. For example:

Native name: Aruvine (from an Islander term)

Steorrian name: Isleleaf or Seafarer’s Herb.


2. Appearance:
The plant is be a hardy shrub native to the coastal or mountainous regions of the Islands, with waxy, dark green leaves to retain moisture in its tropical or subtropical environment. Its flowers are small and fragrant, helping it attract pollinators.


3. Flavor Profile:

Base Flavor: Earthy with subtle floral or citrusy undertones.

Varietal Effects: Depending on the drying or steeping process, it could have variations: smoky, tangy, or even slightly spicy.
This diversity could make it a sought-after luxury item, depending on how it’s prepared.

Infusion Ritual

1. Preparation Method:
The leaves are dried, sometimes roasted, and steeped in hot water. Steorrians might prefer this as a lighter beverage served with sugar or citrus, while Islanders might prepare it stronger and mix it with local spices or roots.


2. Cultural Divergence:
Islanders may use it as part of social bonding or spiritual practices, consuming it in groups around a fire. Steorrians, on the other hand, might emphasize individual consumption as part of leisure or status (e.g., served in delicate cups during formal gatherings).

Worldbuilding Hooks

1. Economic Value:
The infusion becomes a valuable export item, giving the Steorrian colonists control over its trade. This could lead to tension with the Islanders, who see the plant as sacred or integral to their way of life.


2. Environmental Impact:
If Steorrians grow plantations to cultivate the plant for export, they might disrupt native ecosystems, creating friction with the Islanders who rely on wild harvesting.


3. Cultural Symbolism:
For Steorrians, the infusion could symbolize the civilizing force of their empire. For Islanders, it might represent stolen heritage or the colonizers’ appropriation of their culture.


4. Variant Uses:
The plant could have different effects based on preparation:

Raw form: Used as a stimulant or medicine.

Fermented leaves: Used to make a tangy drink.

Smoked or burned: Could induce mild euphoria or visions.

Historical Narrative

The plant’s discovery might tie into the broader history of colonization:

The Steorrian settlers were introduced to it by Islander guides, but over time, they appropriated the practice and commercialized it.

A particularly influential Steorrian noble might have popularized it back home, giving rise to a thriving trade, much to the Islanders’ dismay.
