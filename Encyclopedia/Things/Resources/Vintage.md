The Vintage (sometimes referred to as the "purple peril") is a deep purple liquid with destructive explosive properties created by the [[Wesson family]] for the Steorrian [[Rebellion|Rebellion]]. To produce it, magic is extracted from items delivered to the Sibl√≠ns and combined through a secret alchemical process developed by the Wessons. When unleashed, the volatile Vintage can level buildings and tear ships asunder, making it invaluable to the rebellion. However, it is highly unstable and can cause unintended widespread devastation if not handled with care.


**Vintage**  
*Wondrous item, legendary (destruction)*

This volatile purple liquid contains condensed magical essence distilled from artifacts and imbued items. Vintage is highly unstable and dangerous if handled recklessly. When exposed to air, it detonates in a blast empowered by unleashed arcane energy. Larger amounts cause bigger explosions.

***Vintage Vial (1 oz).*** This glass vial contains 1 ounce of Vintage liquid. As an action, opening the vial causes the Vintage to violently explode. Each creature and unattended, loose object within 15 feet of the vial must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures and objects are pushed 15 feet away from the vial on a failed save.

In addition, each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, roll 1d6 to determine a random debilitating effect that lasts 1 minute:

1. Blinded
2. Deafened  
3. Stunned
4. Blinded and Deafened
5. Blinded and Stunned
6. Deafened and Stunned

***Large Container (1 gallon).*** This iron barrel contains 1 gallon (128 oz) of Vintage. Opening the barrel causes a bigger blast. Each creature and loose object within 30 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Creatures and objects are pushed 30 feet away on a failed save.

Each creature in the area must also make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, rolling 1d6 to determine a random 1 minute effect on a failure.

***Massive Explosion.*** A huge quantity of Vintage, 10 gallons or more, creates a devastating blast. Each creature and object within 60 feet must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d6 force damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. Creatures and objects are pushed 60 feet away on a failed save. 

Each creature in the blast must also make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, rolling 1d6 to determine a random debilitating 1 minute effect on a failed save.
