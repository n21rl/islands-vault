- Merfolk voodoo developed as a form of harnessing the mysterious powers of the deep ocean. Practitioners tap into primal oceanic energies through intricate rituals.

- Voodoo magic uses aquatic components like shells, coral, pearls, fish bones, and driftwood to craft talismans, fetishes, and altars. These channels oceanic forces towards the spellcaster's will.

- To fully master voodoo, merfolk witches undergo mystical rituals to attract the sponsorship of a loa - powerful spirit entities that grant boons. Common merfolk loa take the form of sharks, octopi, eels, or anglerfish.

- Merfolk voodoo incorporates a complex symbolism system of sigils that represent concepts like life, death, fertility, luck, misfortune etc. These sigils focus intention during spells.

- Music and chanting are integral components of merfolk voodoo. Tribal drums, conch shell horns, and hypnotic humming set the rhythm to call loa and direct energy.

- A hhungan is a merfolk voodoo priestess skilled in divination through shells, crystals, and smoke. They advise tribes and perform protective rituals.

- Darker voodoo arts delve into blood sacrifice and curses to inflict harm. But most avoid these profane practices, striving for balance with the ocean's mysteries.
