There are no actual gods in the traditional sense in this world. There are sources of magic power and powerful users of magic. Both are often mistakenly seen as gods. 

The sources of power are tears in the fabric of reality, leaking magic into the world. The Unwavering Star is one of these tears, not an actual god. There is a similar tear at the bottom of the sea, unseen by most.
