iiFaction: Native Resistance

Overview
The Native Resistance is a loose and often underground movement composed of native Jaw inhabitants who resist foreign domination, primarily by the Selveans and Steorrians. This faction is deeply rooted in the belief that the Jaw should remain independent of any external power. The Native Resistance is varied, with some members focused on cultural preservation, others on armed rebellion, and others still on more subtle forms of resistance like sabotage or subversion.

While some members may not share a unified vision for the future of the Jaw, they all agree that the land should be governed by its native peoples, free from the influence or control of foreign empires. The faction is largely decentralized, operating in small cells, making it hard for any outside authority to eradicate it completely.




Goals

Cultural Preservation: Ensure the survival and thriving of native Jaw customs, languages, and traditions.

Autonomy: Establish a future where the Jaw is ruled by its native people, without interference from Selvea or Steorr.

Exclusion of Foreign Influence: Remove the presence of both Steorrians and Selveans, who are viewed as imperialist forces imposing their cultures and control.

Security and Freedom: Protect native Jaw inhabitants from persecution, forced labour, and exploitation by the Selveans and Steorrians.





Methods

Guerrilla Warfare: In some areas, the Resistance operates as a guerrilla force, launching hit-and-run attacks on foreign military and trade outposts.

Sabotage and Subversion: Disrupt foreign trade routes, communications, and infrastructure, targeting Steorrian and Selvean symbols or assets.

Civil Disobedience: Organise nonviolent protests, strikes, and boycotts to undermine Selvean and Steorrian control of local resources.

Underground Networks: Establish secret networks to smuggle people, goods, and information, facilitating the Resistance’s movements and organizing.

Cultural Resurgence: Promote and protect native festivals, ceremonies, and storytelling traditions, even in the face of Selvean and Steorrian attempts to suppress them.





Ideals

Self-Determination: The native people of the Jaw have the right to determine their own future without outside interference.

Cultural Pride: Native culture is seen as sacred and must be preserved at all costs.

Revolutionary Spirit: Many within the Resistance believe that true freedom can only be achieved through active, often violent, resistance against colonial powers.

Unity Among Natives: The Resistance emphasises solidarity among all natives, transcending ethnic and regional differences to form a united front.

Subfactions

Radical Factions: A militant subset that uses violence to achieve its goals, believing that only through force will the Jaw be freed.

Cultural Revivalists: Focus on educating and spreading native culture, including language, art, and history, in the face of cultural erasure.

Diplomatic Seekers: More moderate members seek to negotiate with Selvean or Steorrian powers, albeit with the goal of securing better conditions for native populations rather than direct rule.

Underground Fighters: Small, secretive cells that operate outside the main movement, focused on sabotage and evading detection.

Leadership and Organisation

Loose Leadership: There is no central leadership, as the movement is often decentralised and composed of different local cells that coordinate in secret.

Charismatic Figures: Resistance leaders are often tribal chiefs, spiritual leaders, or former military leaders who have risen to prominence due to their opposition to foreign rule.

Local Heroes: Many resistance leaders are not formal figures but rather local heroes who lead by example, inspiring others through their actions rather than official titles.

Underground Circles: Small cells form the basis of the organisation, with members often unaware of other factions to prevent infiltration and to protect the overall movement.

Relations with Other Factions

Steorrian Loyalists: Hostile; The Loyalists represent the very forces the Resistance opposes—foreign domination and exploitation of the Jaw.

Steorrian Vanguard: Hostile; Although the Vanguard may have similar goals of independence, their vision of a new Steorrian government is viewed as just another form of foreign control.

Appeasers: Hostile; The Appeasers’ willingness to maintain peace under Selvean rule makes them a direct opposition to the Resistance’s goal of expelling foreign powers.

Shadow Legion: Potential Allies or Hostile; While the Legion’s goal is to provoke war and conflict, they share a disdain for Steorrian and Selvean control. However, the Resistance would view the Legion's tactics as destabilising and a threat to their own autonomy.

Elven Purists: Hostile; Purists represent the Selvean system of hierarchy and subjugation that the Resistance fights against.

Jawists: Potential Allies or Neutral; Jawists and Native Resistance share similar goals of self-governance and autonomy, though Jawists may be less radical and prefer diplomacy over violence.

Native Factions: Allies; The Native Resistance primarily aligns with indigenous people, regardless of their exact tribal affiliation, seeking to unify them against foreign rule.

Strengths

Local Knowledge: Native populations have an intimate understanding of the land, which helps them in guerilla tactics and resistance efforts.

Resilient Spirit: The movement is highly motivated by a desire to preserve culture and protect the land, giving it a deep well of emotional and moral power.

Guerrilla Tactics: The decentralised structure allows them to operate in secrecy and avoid the full force of Selvean or Steorrian reprisals.



---

Weaknesses

Lack of Resources: The Resistance is often underfunded and lacks the military resources to confront large Selvean or Steorrian armies head-on.

Internal Divisions: The different factions within the Resistance—especially between radical militants and cultural preservationists—can create internal strife and weaken their cohesion.

Limited External Support: Though some sympathetic factions may offer covert help, the Resistance often struggles to gain substantial backing from outside powers.

Potential Plot Hooks

Crackdown: The party could be asked to help smuggle a Resistance leader out of a city where Selvean forces are cracking down on uprisings.

Cultural Artifact: The Resistance seeks a valuable cultural artifact that was stolen by the Selveans. The party must retrieve it to preserve the native heritage.

Betrayal: A cell of the Resistance has been infiltrated by a traitor, and the party must uncover who it is before crucial plans are compromised.

Covert Aid: The party could be tasked with delivering a shipment of supplies or weapons to a Resistance cell, navigating dangerous terrain and hostile forces.

The Native Resistance is primarily a faction that places its emphasis on the protection of native people and culture from the dangers of foreign domination, fighting both military occupation and cultural assimilation. Their methods and goals may be seen as extreme by some, but they offer a raw and passionate perspective on the future of the Jaw, with both potential allies and powerful enemies.
