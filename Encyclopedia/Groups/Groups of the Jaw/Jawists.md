Jawists are a diverse political movement centred on the belief that the Jaw should govern itself. Their core ideology is "Jaw-first," prioritising the region’s needs, values, and culture over those of outside powers like Selvea or Steorr. Importantly, they are not synonymous with Natives. While they all advocate for increased autonomy, their visions differ, ranging from complete independence to retaining ties with Selvea under local leadership. Therefore, there are two main subgroups: Autonomists, who seek greater freedom and self-rule within Selvean control and Independentists, who demand the Jaw become a separate nation, free from both Selvean and Steorrian influence. Jawists are not tied to any particular race, class, or background, making them one of the most ideologically varied factions. 

Jawists represent the hope for a Jaw-defined future, offering rich opportunities for political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and the exploration of cultural identity. Their diversity makes them both a strength and a challenge to navigate, creating nuanced conflicts in the campaign.  The Jawists’ diversity makes them a rich source of political intrigue and moral dilemmas, offering the party opportunities to explore themes of identity, unity, and the cost of freedom.

## Goals
 - Self-Governance: Establish local control over laws, resources, and cultural practices, free from foreign dominance.
- Economic Independence: Shift control of trade and resources from Selvean or Steorrian hands to Jaw-based authorities.
- Cultural Preservation: Protect and celebrate the Jaw’s unique blend of traditions, especially those threatened by colonisation.
- Regional Unity: Create a unified Jaw identity, bridging divides between native groups, settlers, and factions.

## Methods
- Political Advocacy: Organise protests, petitions, and negotiations to push for autonomy
- Grassroots Movements: Build support among common people through local leaders and community action.
- Economic Reforms: Promote boycotts of Selvean or Steorrian goods and encourage Jaw-made alternatives.
- Diplomatic Manoeuvring: Autonomists especially seek alliances with Appeasers or sympathetic Selvean officials to gain concessions.
- Radical Action (Independentists): Some extremist Jawists resort to sabotuage, armed rebellion, disrupting trade routes, defacing Selvean symbols, or attacking officials.

## Ideals
- Autonomy and Sovereignty: Whether as an autonomous state or independent nation, the Jaw should control its own destiny, not be a pawn in foreign powers’ conflicts or ambitions.
- Inclusivity and Unity Across Divides: Anyone willing to prioritise the Jaw is welcome, regardless of race or origin. Jawists aim to bring together natives, settlers, and others under a shared regional identity.
- Pragmatism: Many Jawists favour incremental reforms rather than outright revolution to achieve their goals.
- Resistance to Exploitation: Oppose any system that treats the Jaw as a resource to be exploited by foreign powers.

## Subgroups
- Autonomists; Moderate Jawists Seek greater local governance within the Selvean system, akin to a semi-autonomous state.
- Independentists: Demand complete independence, rejecting any ties to Selvea or Steorr.
- Cultural Revitalists: Focus on preserving native Jaw traditions, advocating for a culturally distinct Jaw identity.
- Militants: A minority faction that believes peaceful means have failed and that violence is necessary to achieve self-rule.
This split creates ideological tensions but also allows the movement to draw support from a diverse range of people.

## Leadership and Organisation
- Local Leaders: Community figures such as influential merchants, priests, scholars and community organisers often emerge as Jawist figureheads.
- Coalitions: Jawists work through broad alliances, which can make them disorganised but also adaptable.The movement’s diversity can make it flexible but also prone to internal conflict.
- Diverse Support Base: Includes native peoples, disenfranchised settlers, and younger Selveans born in the Jaw.
- Cultural Advocates: Many leaders are also champions of local traditions, emphasising the Jaw’s unique identity.


## Relations with Other Factions
- [[Steorrian Loyalists]]: Neutral to Hostile; some Jawists see Loyalists as potential allies against Selveans, but most reject foreign control altogether.
- [[Steorrian Vanguard]]: Neutral to Hostile; the Vanguard's vision for a new Steorrian nation conflicts with the Jawists' autonomy.
- [[Appeasers]]: Neutral to Opposed; Autonomists may align with Appeasers to gain concessions and push for gradual reform, but Independentists view them as collaborators
- [[Shadow Legion]]: Hostile; the Legion’s desire to reignite war threatens the Jaw’s stability.
- [[Elven Purists]]: Hostile; Purists see Jawists as a direct challenge to Selvean supremacy.
- [[Jaw Native Resistance|Native Resistance]]: Potential Allies; both share goals of preserving native traditions, but Jawists are broader in scope and often less militant.

## Strengths
- Diverse Membership: Their inclusivity draws support from a wide range of backgrounds from natives, settlers, and even sympathetic Selveans.
- Deep Local Support: Many in the Jaw see Jawists as representing their interests and values.
- Adaptability: The faction’s loose structure allows it to respond flexibly to political changes.
- Cultural Pride: Their emphasis on local identity inspires loyalty and passion.

## Weaknesses
- Internal Divisions: Differing visions for the Jaw’s future create friction within the movement.
- Limited Resources: Jawists often struggle to match the military and economic power of larger factions.
- Dependence on Diplomacy (Autonomists): Without major backing, they rely heavily on negotiations and concessions. Their approach relies on Selvean willingness to compromise.
- Internal Divisions: Tensions between Autonomists and Independentists hinder coordination.


## Potential Plot Hooks
- Community Crisis: A Jawist leader asks for the party’s help mediating a dispute between moderate and militant members.
- Sabotage or Reform?: The party must choose whether to support Jawist protests or thwart a planned attack by extremists.
- Cultural Revival: Jawists commission the party to recover a relic or knowledge vital to the Jaw’s cultural heritage.
- Selvean Retaliation: The party learns of a crackdown on Jawist leaders and must decide whether to intervene.
- Split Leadership: The party is asked to mediate between Autonomist and Independentist leaders to keep the movement unified.
- Appeaser Alliance: Autonomists seek the party’s help in forming an alliance with Appeasers, but the Independentists oppose the move.
- Independence Rebellion: Independentists ask the party to help plan or execute a daring act of rebellion, forcing them to weigh the cost of violence.
- Sabotage or Subversion: A militant Jawist faction plans a dangerous attack that could harm civilians, and the party must decide whether to intervene.







## Autonomists

Goals: Establish self-rule while maintaining ties with Selvea. They aim for a system where the Jaw governs its internal affairs, including laws, trade, and culture, while still benefiting from Selvean protection and trade networks.

Methods:
- Work within the Selvean system, pushing for reforms through political advocacy.
- Align with moderate Selvean factions like the Appeasers to gain leverage.
- Avoid direct confrontation with Selvean authorities to ensure peaceful negotiations.

Ideals: Pragmatic and cooperative, valuing stability and economic growth over revolutionary change.


## Independentists

Goals: Total independence from Selvea and Steorr, creating a sovereign Jaw nation. They envision a self-sufficient Jaw with its own government, economy, and military.

Methods:
- Organise protests, boycotts, and acts of civil disobedience to undermine Selvean authority.
- In extreme cases, sabotage or rebellion to force Selvea to relinquish control.
- Rally local support by emphasising cultural pride and the injustices of foreign rule.

Ideals: Nationalistic and uncompromising, believing true freedom requires complete self-determination.
