The Steorrian Vanguard is a faction of Steorrians in the Jaw who feel betrayed by the Kingdom of Steorr after the territory was ceded to Selvea. While they maintain a strong sense of Steorrian identity and values, they have rejected loyalty to the current Steorrian monarchy and envision a new, independent Steorrian state in the Jaw. They see themselves as the vanguard of a renewed, stronger Steorrian civilisation, one not shackled by the compromises or perceived failures of the old regime.
The Steorrian Vanguard is a faction of bold reformers and disillusioned patriots, offering a unique perspective on independence and identity within the Jaw. Their vision of a new Steorrian state adds layers of complexity to the political and cultural dynamics of the campaign.

## Goals
- Establish a New Steorrian Nation: Create a sovereign Steorrian state in the Jaw, independent from both Selvea and the Kingdom of Steorr.
- Reimagine Governance: Replace the old monarchy with a new system (details vary, with some favouring republicanism, others a military-led state).
- Revitalise Steorrian Identity: Preserve Steorrian culture, including its religious and social values, while adapting them for a modern, independent future.
- Resistance Against Selvean Rule: Actively undermine Selvean governance and influence in the Jaw.


## Methods
- Grassroots Organisation: Build support among disillusioned Steorrians in the Jaw through local leadership, public speeches, and community events.
- Revolutionary Tactics: Engage in sabotage, armed resistance, and strategic raids against Selvean targets.
- Alliance-Building: While primarily focused on Steorrian goals, some Vanguard leaders advocate temporary alliances with other factions (e.g., Jawists or Native Resistance) to oust Selvea.
- Ideological Propaganda: Spread their vision of a new Steorrian state through writings, sermons, and cultural revival projects.

## Ideals
- Rejection of Monarchy: The Vanguard views the Steorrian monarchy as weak and unworthy of allegiance, believing it abandoned the Jaw for political convenience.
- Steorrian Supremacy in Identity: They prioritise Steorrian culture and religion but are more open to non-Steorrian allies if they support independence and autonomy.
- Adaptation over Tradition: While valuing Steorrian heritage, they advocate for pragmatic reform, such as embracing new governance structures or military tactics.
- Self-Reliance: Independence is paramount, and they see both Steorr and Selvea as external powers that must not control their future.

## Leadership and Organisation
- Decentralised Leadership: The Vanguard is composed of semi-autonomous cells led by charismatic or military-trained individuals, fostering flexibility but also internal disagreement.
- Military Influence: Many leaders are former Steorrian officers or soldiers disillusioned by the Kingdom’s retreat from the Jaw.
- Grassroots Base: The Vanguard’s core supporters are Steorrians who feel abandoned by both Selvea and Steorr.

## Relations with Other Factions
- [[Steorrian Loyalists]]: The Vanguard views Loyalists as out-of-touch monarchists clinging to a failed regime, while Loyalists see the Vanguard as traitors to Steorr.
- Selvean Appeasers: They oppose Appeasers for enabling Selvean rule and consider them collaborators.
- [[Jawists]]: The Vanguard may align temporarily with some Jawists to oppose Selvea, but their ultimate visions are incompatible—Jawists seek diverse governance, while the Vanguard prioritises Steorrian dominance.
- [[Jaw Native Resistance|Native Resistance]]: They sometimes cooperate with Native Resistance groups against Selvea but often clash due to the Vanguard’s prioritisation of Steorrian identity.
- [[Shadow Legion]]: The Vanguard is directly opposed to the Shadow Legion, whose goal of reigniting war with Steorr risks undermining the Vanguard’s independence movement.
- [[Elven Purists]]: Vanguard members disdain the Purists’ emphasis on Elven superiority and their loyalty to Selvean ideals, viewing them as ideological enemies.

## Strengths
- Passionate Supporters: Their cause resonates strongly with disillusioned Steorrians, fostering loyalty and determination.
- Strategic Flexibility: Their decentralised structure allows for adaptive responses to changing circumstances.
- Visionary Appeal: Their blend of tradition and reform makes them a compelling alternative to both Loyalists and Selveans.

## Weaknesses
- Fragmentation: Internal disagreements about the exact nature of their proposed government could lead to splintering.
- Limited Resources: Without the backing of a powerful nation, they must rely on local support and stolen supplies.
- Ethnic Tensions: Their focus on Steorrian identity risks alienating potential allies, especially natives and Selvean hybrids.

## Potential Plot Hooks
- Faction Split: The party is approached by two Vanguard leaders with differing visions for the future, forcing a choice.
- Steorrian Refugees: The Vanguard asks the party to escort a group of Steorrian settlers to safety from Selvean patrols.
- Conflict with Loyalists: A Vanguard group attacks a Loyalist gathering, sparking a feud that could weaken both factions.
- Allied Rebellion: The Vanguard seeks the party’s help in negotiating with Jawists or natives to stage a coordinated uprising against Selvean forces.
