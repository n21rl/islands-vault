The **Tetzilwahi** were a tribe of **drow elves** who lived high in the canopies of their sacred mounds. They were a feared **raider culture**, striking under the cover of night with illusion magic and guerrilla tactics. Though formidable warriors, they were also artisans, performers, and spiritualists, **honoring their mounds as living gods**.

## Society & Way of Life
Tetzilwahi culture was built around three core principles:

1. **The Masked Gods** – The belief that their sacred mounds housed spirits and should be revered.
2. **The Art of Illusion** – Their use of deception, misdirection, and magic in both daily life and warfare.
3. **The Strength of the Matriarch** – A tradition of female leadership, where the most skilled raiders governed the tribe.

Their society functioned as a **matriarchy**, where the most accomplished female warriors held positions of power. While men could also fight, they often took on roles as **caretakers, artisans, and performers**.

Many Tetzilwahi men, including **Lanternhead before his transformation**, were skilled in **illusion magic** and storytelling, using their abilities to entertain and weave cultural narratives.

## Raiding Tradition
The Tetzilwahi were known for **their night raids**, a practice that made them infamous among their neighbors. Under the cover of darkness, their warriors would:

- **Use illusions** to appear more numerous or terrifying.
- **Strike swiftly and retreat**, vanishing into the jungle before retaliation.
- **Avoid unnecessary bloodshed**, often preferring deception over direct combat.

While their raids were once an accepted part of life in the Jaw, the arrival of **Steorrian forces** disrupted this balance.

## The Fall of the Tetzilwahi
With Steorrian conquest came punitive raids against the Tetzilwahi, intended to wipe them out as a threat. Their canopy dwellings, once impenetrable, were burned and torn down.

During this time, [[Lanternhead]] was taken as a captive, his tribe scattered or destroyed. What little remains of their culture is shrouded in myth, and it is unclear if any Tetzilwahi survived or if they were absorbed into other societies.

Whether the **raiders of the canopy** will ever rise again is unknown, but some whisper that **masked figures still move in the shadows of the jungle**, waiting for the right time to return.
