The Steorrian Loyalists are a faction rooted in allegiance to the Kingdom of Steorr. They believe that the Jaw is an inseparable part of Steorrian territory and see the ceding of the Jaw to Selvea as a temporary setback. They aim to return the Jaw to Steorrian rule under the kingdom, preserving its monarchical governance and theocratic values.

## Goals

- Reunification: Re-establish the Jaw as a territory of the Kingdom of Steorr.
- Preservation of Steorrian Culture: Maintain and reinforce Steorrian religious, cultural, and social systems in the Jaw, particularly the worship of the Unwavering Star.
- Resistance to Selvean Influence: Eliminate Selvean governance and cultural dominance over the Jaw.
- Protection of Steorrians: Ensure the safety and prosperity of Steorrian settlers in the region.

## Methods

- Political Advocacy: Rally support within Steorr to reclaim the Jaw through diplomatic or political pressure.
- Military Action: They are not averse to violence or armed resistance, particularly against Selvean forces, if it furthers their cause.
- Community Organisation: Strengthen Steorrian identity among settlers in the Jaw through festivals, religious gatherings, and education, building a strong base of cultural loyalty.
- Espionage and Sabotage: Some Loyalist groups may resort to covert operations to weaken Selvean control or intimidate collaborators.





## Ideals

- Theocratic Unity: Steorrian Loyalists believe that the Jaw should align with the religious tenets of the Unwavering Star. They view Selvean spiritual practices, such as human sacrifice and cannibalism, as abhorrent.
- Monarchical Governance: They see the Steorrian monarchy as the rightful and stable governing system for the Jaw, contrasting Selvean decentralisation and factionalism.
- Steorrian Supremacy: While not inherently exclusionary, Loyalists prioritise Steorrians' rights and leadership, viewing Steorrian culture as morally and politically superior.

## Leadership and Organisation

- Hierarchy: Loyalist groups tend to mirror Steorrian governance, with leaders taking on roles resembling noble or military commanders. These leaders often have ties to the Steorrian clergy or aristocracy.
- Support Base: Most of their support comes from Steorrian settlers in the Jaw who feel alienated by Selvean rule. They may also gain clandestine support from the Kingdom of Steorr.
- Key Figures: Prominent Loyalists are likely former military officers, clergy members, or political agitators with strong connections to Steorr.

## Relations with Other Factions

- [[Steorrian Vanguard]]: The Loyalists share a desire for Steorrian-led governance, but they view the Vanguard's push for a new Steorrian nation as a betrayal of loyalty to the Kingdom.
- [[Appeasers]]: Loyalists see Appeasers as collaborators enabling Selvean dominance, making them natural enemies.
- [[Jawists]]: Loyalists dismiss the Jawists’ vision of a hybrid culture as compromising Steorrian values, though they might ally temporarily against Selvean rule.
- [[Jaw Native Resistance|Native Resistance]]: The Loyalists often clash with Native Resistance groups, as they view Steorrian settlers’ presence in the Jaw as non-negotiable.
- [[Elven Purists]]: Loyalists view Purists with suspicion and disdain, as the Purists’ overt focus on Elven supremacy directly opposes Steorrian identity.





## Strengths
- Cultural Cohesion: Strong alignment with Steorrian religion and traditions provides a unifying force among their supporters.
- External Support: Potential backing from the Kingdom of Steorr gives them resources and legitimacy.
- Clear Vision: Their goals are straightforward, making them an appealing choice for Steorrian settlers disillusioned by Selvean rule.





Weaknesses

Resistance to Change: Their rigid loyalty to the Kingdom of Steorr might alienate Jaw locals seeking autonomy or reform.

Ethnic Tensions: Their prioritisation of Steorrian identity risks marginalising other groups in the Jaw, including natives and mixed populations.

Dependence on Steorr: Without consistent support from the Kingdom, their movement could falter.





Potential Plot Hooks

Rebellion Plans: The Loyalists recruit the party for a covert mission to sabotage Selvean supply lines, but the mission risks civilian lives.

Internal Debate: A faction leader considers compromising with the Vanguard to form a united front but faces backlash from traditionalists.

Conflict with Natives: Native Resistance groups retaliate against Loyalist encroachment, forcing the party to mediate or take sides.

Steorrian Support: A Loyalist agent reveals secret correspondence with the Kingdom of Steorr, indicating a planned military intervention.





The Steorrian Loyalists offer a faction rooted in tradition, resistance, and loyalty to a larger homeland, presenting a compelling mix of political intrigue and cultural tension.
