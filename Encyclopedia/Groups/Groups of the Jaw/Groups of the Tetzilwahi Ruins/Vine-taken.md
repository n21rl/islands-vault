"The jungle does not kill. It keeps."

Theme: Parasitism, overgrowth, memory loss, body horror  
Tone: Eerie, slow, overgrown, mute menace

The Vine-Taken are not a people, but a condition. Semi-sentient plant-humanoid hybrids formed from corpses, dreamers, and explorers who stayed too long in the wrong places. They are grown, not born—caught between memory and instinct, compelled to spread and convert.






The “Vine-Taken” are not a conventional faction but rather the human (and humanoid) casualties of the Hollow and the Green Veil’s magic. They are individuals who remained in the ruins too long, were ensnared by the enchanted flora, and underwent a horrific transformation into plant-human hybrids. Essentially, the jungle “kept” them – entangling them in vines, infiltrating their bodies, and sustaining them in a half-living, half-dreaming state. Over time, they lost their original identity and became extensions of the jungle’s will. Some were likely original Tetzilwahi who refused to leave or died here; others might be later explorers (a few unlucky Takers, perhaps even a low-ranking Maskbearer or two who wandered without protection). The transformation can take days or weeks of exposure to spores and consumption of tainted water/food from the ruins. Externally, a Vine-Taken might look like a corpse animated by creeping vines – their skin is bark-like in patches, eyes milky with sap, and limbs contorted with fibrous growths. Some have flowers blooming where hair once was. They often remain tangled into walls or floors until disturbed.

Motivation/Behavior: Individually, Vine-Taken have little to no intellect or memory left of their past. They behave like guardians of the area or like predators responding to stimuli. When not stimulated, many Vine-Taken stand eerily still, sometimes even rooted in place with toes and fingers fused into the ground or adjacent foliage. They might pose as ordinary vines or tree trunks. When they sense trespassers (via vibrations, sound, or the smell of flesh), they animate with sudden ferocity. They attempt to drag living prey into the vines, either strangling them or holding them still so that spores can work on the new victim. In a twisted way, they “assimilate” more into their fold by creating new Vine-Taken from those they catch (though this process isn’t instantaneous, any captive left behind could eventually turn).

Some Vine-Taken exhibit remnants of behavior: for example, a pair might walk a repeating path together, as if mimicking a patrol they used to do in life. Others might whisper or moan fragments of their last thoughts. Hearing a cluster of Vine-Taken softly crying _“We failed… we failed…”_ in the dark is a chilling possibility (indeed some areas have such echoes). This makes them tragic figures – they aren’t evil by choice but rather victims beyond saving. If one could communicate with them (like speak with plants or a restoration spell), they might briefly recall who they were, but this is very difficult and likely fleeting.

The Jungle’s Influence: In game terms, treat the Vine-Taken similarly to creatures like Vine Blights, Needle Blights, or Yellow Musk Zombies – plant creatures that can grapple, poison, and ambush. They are essentially extensions of the jungle’s consciousness (which might be passively influenced by Mama Yaya’s presence or just the raw magic of the place). They do not negotiate or retreat; they fight until destroyed, or until their prey is gone, then return to a dormant state. They also interact oddly with the Hollow – for example, a character might see a Vine-Taken as a normal person in a hallucination, only for it to flicker back to reality as a monster lunging at them. The boundary of dream and life is blurred in these creatures.

Notable Types of Vine-Taken:  
While not individuals with names, you can differentiate encounters:

- The Silent Walkers: These are clusters of 2-4 Vine-Taken that stand in a circle as if in silent conversation. They might have been a patrol or family that got taken together. They remain motionless until someone comes near, at which point one might whisper a warning like _“You… should not be here…”_ right before they all attack. That single moment of apparent lucidity could spook players – it’s actually the dying echo of the person’s mind trying to warn others, but it’s quickly drowned by the vines’ impulse to feed.
    
- The Rooted Ones: Some Vine-Taken have effectively become part of the architecture. For instance, a once-powerful warrior’s body is now fused into a wall of tangled roots, only an arm and half their face visible. These types might act as sentries: they can’t move, but they can lash out with extending vines or issue a cloud of spores. Destroying them might reveal valuables they carried (e.g. a rusted sword, a locket, etc.).
    
- The Marshlings: In flooded areas, Vine-Taken can be submerged with only faint outlines under algae to give them away. They might rise from murky water to grab ankles. These often have swollen bodies filled with water and gas – possibly exploding in a burst of spores if killed (consider a death burst that forces a CON save vs poison).
    
- (Optional) The First Taken: An especially poignant idea: perhaps Oraya II Doltha herself could be encountered as a unique Vine-Taken if Mama Yaya hadn’t fully merged with the body or left something behind. This could be an emotional reveal – a regal-looking Vine-Taken that does not attack, just endlessly repeats a motion like reaching toward an altar. This figure could wear tattered Selvean and native clothing. If the party realizes who it is (through journals or context), they might attempt to put Oraya II to rest. (This is entirely optional and depends on how much you want to emphasize her fate aside from being Yaya’s host. Maybe Yaya’s “possession” shed Oraya’s soul which then got claimed by the vines, resulting in this sad creature separate from Yaya. Only include if it fits your narrative.)
    

Faction Relations: The Vine-Taken don’t have alliances or true animosities – they attack anyone not already “of the vine.” However, each faction perceives them differently:

- The Takers treat them like hazardous wildlife. Experienced Takers know the signs (they avoid areas with too many corpse-like vines, mark “DO NOT ENTER” in chalk at certain tunnels, etc.). When forced to fight Vine-Taken, Takers use torches and blades, often burning the remains thoroughly. They have a bit of a folktale that breathing the _“green breath”_ (spores) will doom you, so they cover their mouths with cloth if they expect Vine-Taken. If the party teams up with Takers, expect any Vine-Taken encounter to have the Takers freak out more than usual, as these monsters spook them. A Taker might even abandon the party mid-fight out of fear.
    
- The Maskbearers have an almost religious awe/disgust for the Vine-Taken. Low-ranking cultists might think they are simply _“guardians set by the gods”_ and so they’ll avoid Vine-Taken areas (preferring to fight Takers elsewhere). Higher-ranking Maskbearers, who consider the possibility of failure, whisper that the Vine-Taken are _what happens when the jungle judges you_. There are rumors in the cult that a Maskbearer who falters in faith could become one of those monsters – this keeps members in line. In practice, if Maskbearers must go through a Vine-Taken lair, they do so in force with spells and fire, chanting prayers as they hack the creatures down (and they will ceremonially burn any fallen cultist’s body immediately, so it cannot “rise”). The cult does not attempt to communicate with the Vine-Taken – they see them as mindless, perhaps because admitting they were people would be too disturbing.
    
- Mama Yaya likely sees the Vine-Taken as neither good nor bad, but a natural outcome of her Hollow on mortals. She might occasionally use them as eyes and ears; for example, she could see through the eyes of one (using a power like a hag’s animal sight ability, but with plant creatures) or send a sort of command to them in a dream. So if it serves her narrative, she might subtly herd Vine-Taken toward or away from the party. The players wouldn’t know this, of course – it would just feel like sometimes the monsters show up at oddly convenient or inconvenient moments.
    

Possible Interaction: While true communication is nearly impossible, very compassionate or clever players might try things like remove curse, lesser restoration, or speak with plants on a Vine-Taken. At your discretion, a spell like _lesser restoration_ could give a Vine-Taken a saving throw to regain a fragment of humanity (maybe allowing a brief conversation). They won’t be fully cured (that would likely require _regenerate_ or _heal_ at minimum, or a wild fey bargain), but you could reward the attempt with a useful clue: e.g. a Vine-Taken murmurs _“mask… behind… left”_ hinting at a hidden mask in the area, or _“Yaya… still lives”_ hinting at Mama Yaya’s existence. This kind of moment can emphasize the tragedy – even after freeing its mind for a minute, the person still dies as the vines choke out their life once the magic fades.

 The Vine-Taken: Not a society but a phenomenon – these are individuals (humans, elves, goblins, etc.) who lingered too long in the deepest, most overgrown parts of the ruins and were overtaken by the living jungle. Vines have merged into their flesh and minds, turning them into shambling plant-human horrors. They are an unintended “faction” in that they populate the innermost, flooded halls, attacking intruders like guardians of the jungle’s heart. Selvean soldiers and others who have seen them simply regard them as _“dangerous plant monsters,”_ not realizing many were once people.

#### Why They Want the Grand Mound:
- Its root network feeds their growth. It is a spiritual anchor and the center of their hive memory. They don’t want to rule it—they want it to collapse and seed the jungle.
