A fanatical cult that formed around recovered Tetzilwahi lore. They view the ruins as sacred and believe the old gods can be revived or harnessed. Tragically, they have misinterpreted the old ways: instead of understanding that the masks were for the mounds, the Maskbearers wear carved wooden or stolen ceremonial masks themselves, thinking this lets them channel the ancestral spirits. They perform new, violent rituals (even human sacrifice) in an attempt to gain the gods’ favor and magical power. They are essentially reinventing the Tetzilwahi religion in a twisted way.


Theme: Ritual misinterpretation, reverence, flawed reconstruction  
Tone: Ceremonial, passionate, misguided, zealous

Descended from or inspired by old Tetzilwahi traditions, the Maskbearers seek to preserve what they believe are sacred rites. However, their understanding of the original culture is warped, filtered through fragmentary texts and half-remembered visions. They worship masks as divine intermediaries and perform elaborate, beautiful, but incorrect rituals.

The believe the -ground mound  is the cradle of divine mask-making and the heart of the gods' silence. To reclaim it is to validate their entire belief system.

### The Maskbearers (Zealots of the Lost Gods)

Who They Are: The Maskbearers are a cult that formed around the myths of the Tetzilwahi. They are a mix of people: some are of partial native descent seeking to reconnect with “lost gods,” others are mystics, druids, or even former soldiers disillusioned with conventional religion who turned to the jungle’s power. What unites them is a fervent belief that the spirits/gods of the Tetzilwahi mounds still dwell here – and that these powers can be taken or bargained with to elevate the faithful. They call themselves “Maskbearers” because of their practice of wearing masks in ritual and battle. Many wear crude wooden masks carved to resemble the big god-masks, or they steal fragments of the authentic masks from the ruins and lash them into their armor. Seeing them in the dark can be terrifying – human and elf warriors with distorted, painted faces, some appearing half like forest spirits. They tend to brand or tattoo themselves with vine patterns as well, mimicking the environment.

Importantly, the Maskbearers only possess a fragmentary and distorted understanding of Tetzilwahi traditions. None of the original priests survived to teach them, so the cult fills the gaps with their own interpretations. For example, they know masks were important, but assume the Tetzilwahi priests must have worn them to channel power – so they do the same, not realizing the masks were meant for the mounds. In essence, it’s a cargo-cult: they imitated what they saw (masked idols) in hopes of achieving the revered ancestors’ magic, and developed an extreme ideology around it.

Goals and Motivation: The Maskbearers’ ultimate goal is to awaken the “true power” of the Tetzilwahi gods and claim it for themselves. In their view, the ruins are sacred ground that outsiders (like the Takers) defile by stealing and desecrating. They seek to:

- Recover and Protect Relics: They hunt for any remaining god-masks, carvings, or holy objects. If they find a fragment of a mask, they may perform rites to “sanctify” it (which to an observer might look like spilling blood on it and chanting all night). They believe each piece they collect strengthens the connection to the gods.
    
- Perform Rituals: Deep in the inner ruins, the Maskbearers carry out elaborate rituals drawn from both imagination and bits of genuine lore. For instance, they hold gladiatorial duels to please the war spirits of the ancestors (see _Dueling Grounds_ location), and they offer blood sacrifices at old altars hoping to hear the voices of the gods. A core ritual they seek to complete is the “Last Offering” – they’ve read hints that the Tetzilwahi left one final offering unfinished when their gods went silent. The cult wants to finish this ritual, believing it will resurrect the gods or bestow great power. They lack the full knowledge of what it entails, however, and are scouring for clues (one such clue is carved in the Hollow Library).
    
- Purge Unbelievers: In the long run, the Maskbearers intend to drive out all other interlopers (Takers, colonists, etc.) and make the ruins a holy stronghold. They often talk of the “Day of Masks,” when they will emerge from the jungle empowered by the gods to punish the non-believers. In the short term, this means attacking Taker camps whenever they have the strength, and capturing intruders to either indoctrinate or sacrifice.
    

Attitude and Methods: The Maskbearers are fanatical and disciplined (at least compared to the Takers). They move often in warbands of 3–6, well-armed with spears, bows, and scavenged metal weapons, and they often employ magic (some among them are druids or warlocks who have tapped into the jungle’s fey energy). In battle, they are ferocious, often working themselves into a masked frenzy. However, they are _not_ mindless – they will retreat to protect important sites if losing, and they prefer to strike from ambush or under the cover of illusions (for example, using druidcraft to create distracting rustles, or minor illusions to lure enemies into traps). They make use of the environment: deploying poisoned blowdarts (made from venomous plant sap) or fighting on rope bridges where they have superior agility.

Crucially, not all Maskbearers are equal in zeal. The rank-and-file might just believe in the cause and follow orders, but the leaders (the priests and champions) are deeply consumed by their visions. They may experience genuine hallucinations from ingesting concoctions, which they interpret as divine guidance. Some claim to hear the ancestors whisper through the masks. Unknown to them, many of these “visions” are likely influenced by Mama Yaya testing their resolve or sowing conflict. The Maskbearers revere an enigmatic figure they call “Mama Yaya” – they think of her as a sort of spirit of the mounds or an avatar of the Mother Jungle. Only the highest-ranked Maskbearer mystics ever supposedly commune with Mama Yaya. This belief in Mama Yaya means that if the cult encounters an older woman or strange wise figure in the jungle, they might react with reverence or hesitation, unsure if it’s her in disguise.

Notable NPCs – The Maskbearers:

- Father Haon – The current cult leader, a weathered elf man who serves as the high priest of the Maskbearers. Haon was originally a simple herbalist who lost his family to Steorrian violence and wandered into the jungle seeking meaning. He found the ruins and was “born anew.” He wears an elaborate mask assembled from shards of multiple Tetzilwahi god-masks, giving it a gruesome patchwork look. Father Haon genuinely believes he is guided by the ancestral spirits (he frequently fasts and inhales spores to induce visions). He has a deep, calming voice and speaks in parables. To his followers, he is the conduit of the jungle gods. To outsiders, he might come across as polite but eerily intense. Haon interprets any setback as _“the gods testing our faith.”_ In combat, he’s a capable druid or warlock, commanding thorny vines to ensnare foes or calling on a trained panther. As an NPC, Haon could be reasoned with _if_ one appeals to his faith – for instance, presenting evidence that the party are also “chosen” or that a particular action is the will of the gods. However, betraying him will ignite his wrath. He would rather die than abandon the sacred mission.
    
- Zalra Three-Faces – The cult’s most fearsome champion. Zalra is a human woman of great height, who wears a unique rotating triple-faced mask (one face frowning, one laughing, one blank) – she turns it depending on her battle mood. She earned the name “Three-Faces” for that mask and for her unpredictable demeanor. At times she’s almost mirthful, toying with opponents; at others, cold and merciless. Zalra leads raids on the Takers and personally trains new warriors in ritual combat. She has a habit of issuing duels: when intruders are caught, she might insist on fighting one-on-one to prove the supremacy of the faith. She fights with dual scimitars and has the multiattack routine of a seasoned fighter (stats akin to a Knight or Gladiator). Zalra might respect a party member who can defeat her in honorable combat (potentially sparing the party if bested). Conversely, if she defeats a PC in a formal duel, she might spare them but mark them with a painted mask symbol, effectively saying _“you belong to us now; return as one of us or next time, no mercy.”_ Zalra is utterly loyal to Father Haon but there’s subtle tension – some cultists whisper that Zalra’s bravery outshines Haon’s visions, perhaps a seed for future schism.
    

Faction Relations: The Maskbearers see the Takers as defilers and thieves. Their interactions are usually violent. They will attack Takers to reclaim artifacts or territory. From the Maskbearer perspective, a rusty Steorrian sword is nothing compared to a carved wooden idol – they have opposite values, which makes negotiation almost impossible. However, the cult is few in number compared to the swarms of goblins, so they often rely on guerrilla tactics and choose when and where to strike. They leave warning signs to the Takers, like hanging the corpses of slain scavengers on vines, faces covered in clay masks – psychological warfare to say “leave or this is your fate.” With the Vine-Taken, Maskbearers have a more complex stance. They view the Vine-Taken as both _sacred and profane_. On one hand, the cult’s doctrine might say those who were claimed by the living jungle were _unworthy or performed the rites incorrectly_, thus they became cursed. On the other hand, some Maskbearer seers consider the Vine-Taken to be _unfortunate guardians_ left by the gods – meaning the cult should not fear dying at their hands because “only the unfaithful are taken.” Practically, Maskbearers will destroy Vine-Taken if they interfere, but they also might deliberately leave sacrifices (like a dead animal or even a prisoner) in a vine-choked hall to appease “the hungry jungle.” They occasionally attempt rituals to “free” a Vine-Taken (without success). As for Mama Yaya, the Maskbearers revere her legend. Father Haon claims to receive visions from Mama Yaya, reinforcing his leadership. If the real Mama Yaya ever directly approaches them, likely only Haon or a few shamans would realize it’s her – and they’d probably fall to their knees in worship. This means the cult could actually become pawns for Yaya’s desires if she chooses to direct them (something she might do to oppose the players if they threaten her).
