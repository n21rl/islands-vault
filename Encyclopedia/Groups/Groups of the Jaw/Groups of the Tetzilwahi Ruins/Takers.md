Goblins & Other Scavengers (Pragmatic Survivors)

- Why are they there?
    - The overgrown ruins make a great hideout, perfect for ambushes or smuggling operations.
    - The dense plant growth provides natural cover, making it easy to escape detection.
    - They don’t care about the village’s history—to them, it’s just an abandoned place to use.
- Why do they see the gods as dead?
    - They view the masked plant-mounds as eerie ruins but nothing more.
    - If the “gods” were real, why didn’t they stop the Steorrians from taking the land?
    - Some might desecrate the mounds, carving them into shelters or breaking pieces off to use as tools.
- What kind of goblins?
    - Maybe a pirate-adjacent group, hiding from the law.
    - Maybe a group of feral, exiled goblins, outcast even by their own kind.
    - Maybe other fey creatures mixed in—redcaps, spriggans, or quicklings, treating the village as a playground.

⮕ Story Potential: Lanternhead sees his people’s sacred site turned into a hideout for scavengers and thieves, its history completely lost.


- The goblins here aren’t part of any larger goblin kingdom—they are scavengers and exiles, trying to survive.
- They don’t care about the history of the village—they just use what’s left.
- They’ve built ramshackle homes inside the abandoned plant-mounds, carving tunnels into the roots and hollowing out sacred spaces.
- Some believe the masks on the mounds once held power, but if they did, that power is long gone.




⮕ What They Think About Lanternhead’s People:
- _“They’re gone. If they were strong, they’d still be here.”_
- _“The gods didn’t save them, so why should we care?”_
- _“Magic belongs to whoever can take it. No more gods, no more rules.”_


## Scavengers (Bonepickers)

### Theme: Exploitation, survival, desecration-as-habit

### Faction Mood: Loud, chaotic, resourceful, disrespectful

Theme: Desecration, exploitation, survival through irreverence  
Tone: Chaotic, crude, opportunistic, blasphemous

The Bonepickers are goblins, smugglers, and desperate survivors who see the ruins not as sacred ground, but as a resource-rich treasure hoard. They loot masks, hack vines, and repurpose sacred sites for commerce and bloodsport.

_Survivors, traders, raiders, smugglers, warlords. They see the Mounds as a prize to be claimed or exploited._|


### The Takers (Scavengers & Survivors)

Who They Are: “Takers” is a catch-all term the locals use for those who have come to take whatever they can from the ruins. They include scavengers, smugglers, escaped slaves, ex-soldiers, goblin clans, and petty warlords – anyone drawn by profit or seeking a refuge outside the law. Many are goblins, as the ruins provide an excellent hideout for goblinkind on the run (and the goblins are small enough to navigate certain collapsed tunnels easily). There are also humans and half-orcs (bandits or deserters from the war) among them. They have banded together only loosely; infighting is kept in check by a few strong leaders who maintain order in their own camps. For the Takers, the sanctity of the site means nothing – it’s a hostile jungle dungeon that just happens to be full of valuable loot and shelter.

Goals and Motivation: The Takers’ overriding goal is survival and profit. They want to exploit the ruins’ resources:

- Treasure: They strip wall carvings, pry gemstones from statues, loot any remaining Tetzilwahi artifacts or Steorrian weapons left behind. A well-preserved ceremonial mask from a mound could fetch a huge price, and they know it.
    
- Natural Resources: Some Takers (notably a goblin subgroup called the Root Snatchers) collect rare herbs, poisons, and the bioluminescent fungi  for sale. They ferment the glowing fungus into a hallucinogen popular in black markets.
    
- Territory: They treat the outer ruins as their camp and marketplace. There’s even a semi-neutral trading post where different scavenger gangs meet to barter finds (and where outsiders might negotiate for passage or information). Holding this territory gives them a safe zone away from patrolling imperial soldiers.
    

Attitude and Methods: The Takers are pragmatic and opportunistic. They are not uniformly evil – think of them as ruthless survivalists. They can be bargained or reasoned with if one speaks their language (gold, goods, or leverage). However, they are quick to turn on anyone if the reward is high enough. Many Takers are heavily armed with scavenged gear, but poorly organized beyond small squads. They prefer ambush tactics in the ruins they know well. They set simple traps (tripwires attached to noise-makers or crossbows, pits covered with fronds in the underbrush, etc.) to guard their zones, and use trained creatures like boars or giant lizards as watch-beasts. If threatened by a stronger force, they retreat and regroup, possibly leading pursuers into Vine-Taken areas intentionally (better the jungle monsters deal with the problem).

The Takers have no respect for the “old gods” of the mounds. Some openly desecrate the remaining idols for amusement. A common sentiment among them: _“If these jungle spirits were real, they sure didn’t save their people. So why fear them?”_ However, many Takers are superstitious in a general sense. They may blame “jungle ghosts” (like Mama Yaya’s legend) for disappearances, and they fear the Vine-Taken as curses. They rely on torches and fire to keep the “creeping vines” at bay.

Notable NPCs – The Takers:

- Skeld “Scorchfang” – A hobgoblin warlord who leads the largest Taker gang. Burly, with burn scars across his jaw, Scorchfang earned his name when he torched a Tendrilwurm (a monstrous vine creature) with alchemical fire. He wears pieces of shattered Tetzilwahi masks as shoulder armor (to mock the cult). Scorchfang is cunning and utterly self-interested. He brokered a truce among the various scavenger groups so they could collectively hold off the Maskbearers. If approached diplomatically, he might hire the party as muscle (for instance, “clear out those damned cultists from the inner hall and I’ll give you a cut of the loot”). But if crossed, he’ll unleash his gang to hunt the party through the ruins.
    
- Grib the Bonepicker – A goblin trapper and information broker. Grib got his nickname because he literally picks bones out of the rubble (sometimes selling old elf bones to necromancers or collectors). He’s scrawny, with a necklace of finger bones and goggles made from old coins. Unlike Scorchfang, Grib isn’t a fighter – but he knows every secret crawlspace and hidden tunnel in the Outer Mounds. He will cheerfully guide the party past traps or into the heart of the ruins… for a price (and he’ll just as quickly sell them out to the Maskbearers if they pay higher). Grib could be a useful but treacherous ally. He’s also one of the few who trades with outsiders at the Takers’ Market, so the party might meet him early.
    

Faction Relations: The Takers consider the Maskbearers their main threat; the cult’s raiding parties frequently assault Taker camps, destroying loot that the cultists deem “sacred” or capturing Takers for sacrifice. Thus Scorchfang and his ilk have a standing order to kill Maskbearers on sight. Occasionally, though, pragmatic deals occur – a smuggler might quietly sell the cult some stolen relic in exchange for being left alone, for example – but these are rare. The Takers view the Vine-Taken like one would view a hazardous terrain or wild animals: dangerous, but non-intelligent. If Vine-Taken wander into their turf, they’ll mob them with fire and blades to put them down. Takers often warn new recruits: _“Don’t go too deep, or the jungle will take you.”_ They have no idea what Mama Yaya is, and any strange phenomena they encounter they chalk up to “jungle ghosts” or fey tricks. If the party sides with the Takers or earns their trust, they could gain manpower (e.g. a few bandits might help in a fight against the cult) – but such allies will definitely expect a share of treasure and might desert if things get too deadly.


- The Takers: A loose alliance of scavengers, smugglers, and warlords (many of them goblins and other outcasts) who treat the ruins as a trove of resources and a strategic hideout outside imperial control. They fortify the outer ruins and strip whatever they can to sell – ancient bones, artifacts, and exotic plants (including harvesting the Green Veil fungus to make a hallucinogenic drug). They have no reverence for the site’s history.
    

#### Why They Want the Grand Mound:
- Loot, dominance They want to claim it to establish prestige and plunder whatever artifacts remain.
