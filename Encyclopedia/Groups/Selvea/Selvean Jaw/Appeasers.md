The Appeasers are the official faction of the Selvean Empire governing the Jaw. Composed primarily of Selveans, they prioritise maintaining peace through compromise and assimilation, believing that the Jaw can thrive under Selvean rule without further conflict. They aim to stabilise the region by fostering cultural integration and suppressing radical elements on all sides.
The Appeasers represent the official, pragmatic face of Selvean rule, aiming to balance imperial interests with local realities. Their reliance on compromise creates opportunities for both collaboration and conflict.

## Goals
- Preserve Selvean Rule: Maintain control of the Jaw as a Selvean province.
 - Promote Peace: Prevent uprisings or wars through diplomacy and soft power.
- Cultural Integration: Encourage the adoption of Selvean customs while tolerating some local traditions.
- Stabilise Governance: Build efficient administration by blending Selvean and local practices.

## Methods
- Diplomacy: Negotiate with local leaders to ensure loyalty or reduce tensions.
- Economic Incentives: Invest in infrastructure and trade to placate dissenting groups.
- Cultural Outreach: Sponsor festivals, religious ceremonies, and education to spread Selvean ideals.
- Containment of Extremists: Suppress violent factions like the Shadow Legion or Vanguard to avoid instability.

## Ideals
- Benevolent Hegemony: Selvean rule is framed as beneficial, bringing order, prosperity, and enlightenment.
- Pragmatism: They are willing to adopt local customs if it aids stability.
- Moral Superiority: While outwardly tolerant, they view Selvean culture as inherently more advanced.
- Syncretistm: integrating all people into Selvean culture

## Leadership and Organisation
- Governance by Mandate: Led by imperial officials appointed by the Selvean Empire, particularly appeaser-aligned nobles like Paxitli.
- Military and Civil Administration: Work closely with the Selvean military to enforce order but rely more on soft power than brute force.
- Champion Figures: Local leaders, both Selvean and hybrid, are elevated to act as intermediaries.

## Relations with Other Factions
- [[Steorrian Loyalists]]: Hostile; Loyalists resist Selvean rule and undermine peace efforts.
- [[Steorrian Vanguard]]: Opposed; the Vanguard’s revolutionary goals are a direct threat to Selvean governance.
- [[Jawists]]: Mixed; they collaborate with Jawists who seek autonomy under Selvean rule but oppose full independence.
- [[Jaw Native Resistance|Native Resistance]]: Contentious; they work to suppress Native groups that reject Selvean influence but may tolerate those who remain neutral.
- [[Shadow Legion]]: Secretly undermined; while Appeasers and the Shadow Legion are both Selvean, the Legion’s warlike goals are antithetical to Appeaser diplomacy.
- [[Elven Purists]]: Cooperative; both groups support Selvean dominance, though Purists see Appeasers as too lenient.

## Strengths
- Imperial Support: They have the full backing of Selvea, including resources and military strength.
- Political Savvy: Skilled negotiators and diplomats who excel at maintaining balance.
- Cultural Flexibility: Their openness to adaptation fosters cooperation from some locals.

## Weaknesses
- Seen as Overbearing: Many natives and Steorrians view them as imperial oppressors.
- Dependent on Stability: Their approach crumbles in the face of widespread rebellion or war.
- Internal Selvean Tensions: They must constantly manage opposition from the Shadow Legion and Purists.

## Potential Plot Hooks
- Peace Talks: Appeasers enlist the party to mediate between feuding factions.
- Betrayal within Selvea: The party discovers Shadow Legion infiltrators among the Appeasers.
- Aid to Locals: The Appeasers request the party’s help in quelling unrest through non-violent means.
- Festival Disruption: A cultural event sponsored by the Appeasers is targeted by radicals.
