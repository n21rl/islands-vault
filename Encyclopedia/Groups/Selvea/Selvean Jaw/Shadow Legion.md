The Shadow Legion is a secretive faction of Selvean elites, mostly from within the military, who operate independently from the official government. Their primary aim is to reignite war with Steorr, believing that only through decisive military victory can Selvean dominance be solidified. They act in direct opposition to the Appeasers, viewing their diplomatic approach as weak and ineffective. The Shadow Legion's existence is unknown to most of the Selvean leadership, and they manipulate events in the Jaw to provoke conflict.

The Shadow Legion embodies the darker, more ruthless side of Selvean imperialism, willing to sacrifice peace and stability for their vision of ultimate dominance. Their secretive, high-stakes operations provide ample opportunities for intrigue and conflict in the Jaw.


## Goals
- Reignite War: Start a new conflict with Steorr to reassert Selvean military and cultural supremacy.
- Selvean Supremacy: Establish Selvea as the unchallenged power in the Jaw and the wider region.
- Discredit the Appeasers: Undermine Appeaser policies by creating conditions that make peace seem impossible.
- Crush Steorrian Resistance: Eliminate Steorrian Loyalists and other groups seen as threats to Selvean power.

## Methods
- Espionage: Infiltrate factions and stoke tensions between Steorrians, natives, and Jawists.
- Sabotage: Orchestrate violent events, such as arson, assassinations, and uprisings, to destabilise the region.
- False Flags: Stage incidents to frame Steorrian Loyalists or other factions, creating a justification for war.
- Militarisation: Secretly arm and train Selvean loyalists in the Jaw to prepare for open conflict.


## Ideals
- Militarism: The belief that strength and conquest are the ultimate expressions of Selvean greatness.
- Selvean Exceptionalism: The Shadow Legion views Selvean culture as inherently superior and sees Steorr as a threat to civilisation.
- Secrecy and Loyalty: Members of the Shadow Legion operate with extreme secrecy and loyalty to their cause, even above the empire itself.
## Leadership and Organisation
- Tzecto: The faction's leader and a Selvean general with a personal vendetta against Steorr. He outwardly appears loyal to the Selvean Empire while secretly orchestrating the Shadow Legion’s activities.
- Cells of Operatives: The Legion operates in small, independent cells, ensuring plausible deniability for its leadership.
- Military Alignment: Many members are high-ranking officers or veterans who are disillusioned with the Appeasers’ leadership.

## Relations with Other Factions
 - [[Steorrian Loyalists]]: Hostile; they are seen as the primary enemy to be destroyed.
- [[Steorrian Vanguard]]: Hostile; though weaker than the Loyalists, the Vanguard represents a potential threat to Selvean dominance.
- [[Appeasers]]: Covertly opposed; while both are Selvean factions, the Shadow Legion views the Appeasers as traitors to Selvean strength.
- [[Jawists]]: Manipulative; they exploit divisions among Jawists to create instability and weaken autonomy movements.
- [[Jaw Native Resistance|Native Resistance]]: Contemptuous; natives are viewed as obstacles to Selvean dominance, though the Legion may temporarily align with them if it serves their goals.
- [[Elven Purists]]: Collaborative; both factions share a belief in Selvean supremacy, though the Purists prefer cultural dominance while the Legion favours military conquest.

## Strengths
- Strategic Expertise: The Legion is composed of experienced military leaders who excel at planning and execution.
- Secrecy: Their covert nature makes them difficult to identify or eliminate.
- Internal Influence: Many members hold powerful positions within the Selvean government and military.

## Weaknesses
- Risk of Exposure: Discovery of their activities could lead to severe backlash from the Selvean Empire.
- Lack of Popular Support: Their extremist methods alienate many locals and even some Selveans.
- Overreliance on Conflict: Their plans depend on constant unrest and violence, which can backfire.


## Potential Plot Hooks
- Sabotaged Peace Talks: The party uncovers evidence of the Shadow Legion’s involvement in derailing negotiations between factions.
- Double Agent: A Shadow Legion operative seeks to defect and offers critical information to the party.
- False Flag Operation: The party is framed by the Legion for a violent act and must clear their names.
- Direct Confrontation: The party discovers a Shadow Legion base and must decide whether to expose or destroy it.
