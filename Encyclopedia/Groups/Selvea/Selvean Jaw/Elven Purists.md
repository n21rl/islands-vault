The Elven Purists are a faction of Selveans who believe in the cultural and racial superiority of Elves, promoting the dominance of Elven ideals, governance, and traditions in the Jaw. While they do not necessarily advocate for military conflict like the Shadow Legion, they aim to consolidate Selvean power through cultural assimilation, subjugation, and soft power. They are deeply opposed to any Steorrian influence in the region and often look down on non-Elves, including other Selveans.

The Elven Purists provide a subtle but insidious threat, using systemic and cultural means to entrench Selvean rule in the Jaw. Their quiet manipulation and influence offer opportunities for intrigue, moral dilemmas, and social challenges in the campaign.

## Goals
- Preserve and Elevate Elven Identity: Maintain and enforce traditional Elven culture as the dominant force in the Jaw.
- Cultural Supremacy: Promote Selvean customs, religion, and art as the natural order, ensuring the assimilation of other groups.
- Elven Leadership: Keep Elves as the ruling class, ensuring governance and power remain in their hands.
- Undermine Non-Elven Influence: Gradually erode the presence and power of Steorrians, natives, and non-Elven Selveans.

## Methods
- Cultural Propaganda: Use festivals, art, and education to spread Selvean values and diminish competing cultures.
- Legislation and Policy: Push for laws that favour Elves in land ownership, trade, and governance.
- Social Exclusion: Enforce segregationist practices to isolate non-Elves and limit their opportunities.
- Elite Alliances: Work with influential Selvean figures to maintain their hold on power without resorting to overt violence.

## Ideals
- Racial Hierarchy: The belief that Elves, as the pinnacle of civilisation, should naturally lead and that other races are subordinate.
- Cultural Purity: A disdain for syncretism or the blending of Selvean and non-Elven traditions.
- Soft Power Over Violence: Preference for gradual, non-violent domination through cultural influence and systemic bias.
- 
## Leadership and Organisation
- Elven Nobility: The Purists are often led by Selvean aristocrats who have benefitted from the hierarchical structure they seek to preserve.
- Cultural Elites: Artists, philosophers, and religious leaders form the backbone of the movement, shaping public perception.
- Support Network: They rely on bureaucrats and minor officials to implement policies favouring Elves.

## Relations with Other Factions
- [[Steorrian Loyalists]]: Hostile; they oppose Steorrian ideals and see their governance as inherently barbaric.
- [[Steorrian Vanguard]]: Hostile; like Loyalists, the Vanguard threatens Elven cultural dominance.
- [[Appeasers]]: Neutral; while they share a preference for maintaining Selvean control, Purists dislike the Appeasers’ willingness to compromise.
- [[Shadow Legion]]: Cautious Alignment; while both want Selvean dominance, Purists may find the Legion’s violent methods too extreme.
- [[Jawists]]: Opposed; they see Jawists’ calls for autonomy as a direct threat to Selvean rule.
- [[Jaw Native Resistance|Native Resistance]]: Contemptuous; natives are viewed as inferior and are pressured into assimilation or marginalisation.

## Strengths

- Cultural Influence: They shape public opinion and policy through art, education, and social structures.
- Powerful Allies: Many Elves in high-ranking positions quietly support or sympathise with Purist ideals.
- Non-Violent Image: Their preference for soft power makes them seem less threatening compared to overtly militant factions.

## Weaknesses
- Elitism: Their overt favouritism toward Elves alienates other Selveans, who may grow resentful.
- Dependence on Status Quo: Any significant destabilisation of Selvean rule could undermine their influence.
- Resistance to Change: Their rigid ideology makes them inflexible in the face of evolving political dynamics.


# Meta
## Potential Plot Hooks
- Cultural Contest: The party must decide whether to support or disrupt a festival meant to glorify Elven culture.
- Policy Sabotage: The party uncovers laws being drafted that marginalise non-Elves and must decide how to respond.
- Alliances of Convenience: The Purists offer to aid the party in opposing Steorrian Loyalists but at a steep moral cost.
- Exposing Hypocrisy: The party uncovers corruption among Purist leaders who exploit non-Elven workers despite preaching Elven superiority.
