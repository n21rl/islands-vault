The military might of the Selvean empire is built upon a unique dual philosophy: that every citizen is a defender of the realm, and that the art of war is a sacred calling perfected by a select few. This structure gives the empire both immense numerical strength through its levies and a decisive edge through its professional warrior class, the Champions.

The Citizen Levy: The Banners of the Empire
The foundation of the Selvean army is the principle that every citizen is a warrior. From a young age, all Selveans are trained in basic military discipline and magic, ensuring a state of constant readiness. When the empire musters for a major conflict, these citizens are called to form the largest component of the army: the Levy Banners.
 * Organization and Training: The Levy is organized into large regiments known as "Banners," raised from specific provinces or city districts. This system fosters a powerful sense of local pride and camaraderie. A Banner's training is not left to chance; it is the solemn duty of an appointed Champion to drill them, discipline them, and prepare them for the rigors of a campaign. This constant relationship between the elite Champions and the citizen soldiers ensures the Levy is far more capable than a simple militia.
 * Leadership in Battle: In times of war, each Banner is led by the same Champion who trained them. This creates a bond of trust and respect between the professional commander and the citizen troops. The Champion's own martial philosophy, or Path, heavily dictates the Banner's tactics on the battlefield.
The Champions: Selvea's Elite Warrior Class
The Champions are Selvea’s elite, full-time military force. They are warriors of immense skill who have dedicated their lives to mastering the art of combat. A Champion's role is twofold: to serve as the highly respected officer corps for the Citizen Banners, and to form their own exclusive, devastatingly effective fighting units.
Every Champion walks one of two Paths, which are not merely specializations but distinct philosophies on the nature of battle. Both Paths produce warriors of the absolute highest caliber, representing different pinnacles of martial achievement.


The Blood Path: The Unstoppable Tide
The Blood Path embodies the mastery of the physical self, viewing the body as the ultimate instrument of war. These Champions are exemplars of martial prowess, defined by their strength, endurance, and unyielding discipline. The Path's philosophy emphasizes that overwhelming physical power is the most direct route to victory.
 * Dual Role in Combat: Warriors of the Blood Path are uniquely versatile. They can form the unshakeable core of a defensive line, their disciplined shield work and resilience making them an unbreakable wall. However, they are equally adept as shock troops, using their brute force and relentless aggression to shatter enemy formations in ferocious charges.
 * Symbols of Dedication: The commitment of a Blood Path warrior is often made manifest through ritual scars, each one a testament to their devotion and the trials they have endured.
The Spirit Path: The Unseen Blade
Where the Blood Path masters the body, the Spirit Path embodies the intellectual and mystical aspects of combat. These Champions are peerless strategists and warrior-mages who utilize a sophisticated blend of martial arts and spellcasting. They believe true mastery comes from the perfect harmony of mind, body, and magic.
 * Tactical Dominance: A Spirit Path warrior wins a battle before it begins, using strategic foresight and finesse to outmaneuver their foes. On the battlefield, they are a fluid and unpredictable force. They may strike with precision from a distance, use divine or arcane magic to control the flow of combat, or engage in melee with a deadly, graceful efficiency.
 * Guardians of Balance: They see themselves not just as warriors, but as guardians of cosmic balance. They channel their will through disciplined focus rather than raw power, acting as the scalpel to the Blood Path's warhammer.
Command and Battlefield Structure
The entire Selvean military, including both the Levy Banners and the Champion units, is directed by a Champion-General, the supreme commander of forces in a given region, such as Tzecto's command over the Jaw.
On the battlefield, the army is deployed in a flexible and effective manner:
 * The Levy Banners: Commanded by individual Champions, these numerous units form the main body of the army. They can fix an enemy in place, execute flanking maneuvers, or secure territory under the expert guidance of their commanders.
 * The Champion Legions: These are the most powerful units in the Selvean arsenal, composed entirely of Champions. These Legions are deployed to achieve decisive results. A Legion might be composed entirely of Blood Path warriors to act as an unstoppable battering ram, or exclusively of Spirit Path Champions to serve as a magical artillery and assassination force. Most commonly, a Legion is a combined-arms unit, integrating Banners of both Paths to create a balanced and tactically supreme force.
This dual structure makes the Selvean army incredibly formidable. It possesses the mass and staying power of a citizen army, but this force is trained, led, and stiffened by a professional warrior class of unparalleled skill, ensuring that both the quantity and quality of its soldiers are a match for any foe.
