The Champions are Selvea’s elite military force. Within their ranks, two distinct factions exist, each embodying different aspects of Selvean martial philosophy: **the Blood Path** and **the Spirit Path**. These divisions influence the structure of the Champions, the composition of their ranks, and the ideologies they uphold.

## Blood Path (Martial Discipline)

The Blood Path represents the physical and martial prowess of the Champions. Members of this faction are warriors who excel in direct combat, often favoring strength, endurance, and rigorous discipline. The philosophy of the Blood Path emphasizes the body as a vessel of war, trained to endure hardship and dominate enemies through sheer physicality.

- **Fighting Style:** Heavy weapons, brute force tactics, and close-quarters combat.
- **Symbolism:** Blood as a sacred force; warriors ritually scar themselves to demonstrate their commitment.
- **Training:** Grueling physical trials, endurance tests, and hand-to-hand combat drills.
- **Notable Members**: [[Akalan]], a champion known for his strength and the ritual scars on his arms.

## Spirit Path (Magical and Tactical Mastery)

The Spirit Path embodies the intellectual and mystical aspects of combat. These Champions wield magic, strategic foresight, and finesse to outmaneuver their foes. Spirit Path warriors train in a blend of martial arts and spellcasting, believing that true mastery comes from balance between body and mind.

- **Fighting Style:** Precision attacks, divine or arcane magic, ranged combat.
- **Symbolism:** The spirit is a guide; warriors channel their will through disciplined focus rather than brute strength.
- **Training:** Meditation, spellcasting, agility training, and tactical simulations.
- **Notable Members:** ? 

### **Role in the Jaw**
Both factions serve under **Tzecto**, the military leader of the Champions in the Jaw.
