Eason Press is one of the most influential businesses operating within the Siblín Guilds. As the preeminent publishing house, they hold a virtual monopoly on the printing and distribution of materials throughout the island nation.

**History**  
The company traces its origins to a print shop opened in Áine by siblings Norimor and Neverins Eason. Their meticulous craftsmanship and innovation in typography quickly drew attention from the Board guilds. The Eason Press was granted exclusive contracts to handle official documentation and publications.

Eason Press has vast facilities with rows of clattering printing presses operating around the clock. They employ hundreds of binders, typesetters, engravers and other artisans sworn to exacting standards.

Most materials circulated in the Siblín Guild, from guild ledgers and merchant contracts to books and broadsheets, emanate from Eason Press.

Beyond its printing monopoly, Eason Press serves as the de facto regulator and gatekeeper for published content across the islands. The company censors and redacts works before permitting reproduction, giving the family patriarchs immense influence over what knowledge reaches the public's hands. Norimor Eason and his staff of loremaster editors scrutinize manuscripts and submissions. This vetting process is shrouded in secrecy and fraught with allegations of selective censorship.
