The Fishers Guild is a guild in the Siblín Islands. Members fish the seas surrounding the islands, providing a vital food source to the nation. Ships and small boats sail daily from the major ports like Áine, returning heavy with catch. The guild maintains strict quotas and regulations on fishing areas, seasons, and allowable methods. They also run processing plants, distribution centres, and fish markets. Recently, whaling has become an very profitable activity for the guild.
