## Description
The Siblín Guilds are a diverse conglomerate of skilled craftspeople and merchants who formed a major commerce centre in the Islands, from their three city-islands of [[Áine]], [[Ben]], and [[Cad]]. They maintain trade relationships with most of the major powers of the archipelago, including Selvea and the Kingdom of Steorr. 

## Culture
According to legend, a few hundred years ago, Áine and her younger brothers Ben and Cad discovered a triplet of islands and formed a country there with a few followers. Cad harvested materials, Ben crafted items, and Áine sold finished products.
The historicity of this story is debated as there are no records of these three people before the Steorrian conquest in the archipelago. Their race and the fact that they were siblings are also disputed information. Regardless, they are important figures in the society of the Guilds. Some people venerate them as gods, while others see them as symbols to emulate. 
People from all over the region have emigrated to the Siblíns and brought their crafts and religions with them. However, a large portion of the population has adopted the local customs. They honour the siblings and the skills and resourcefulness they represent. Siblín culture values hard work, fair commerce, and advancement through merit.

The Siblíns see unrestricted magic as dangerous and requiring oversight.

## Government
The Siblín Guilds are a corporatist society that is very organised and divided between numerous guilds. A guild is an association that regulates a specific trade in terms of production, quality, training It protects the interests of its members but also enforces rules on them. Every working person or employer must be part of a guild.
The supreme ruling body of the Siblíns is the Board of the Guilds. It consists of 99 seats, which are allocated to the guilds based on the amount of taxes they pay. The seats are reassigned every year, based on the latest tax records. Each seat has one vote, and the majority rules. In case of a tie, the Chair, a special seat elected by all board members, breaks the tie. The Board decides on matters of national and international scope, such as trade agreements, security, diplomacy, law It also appoints or dismisses various officials, such as port authorities, inspectors, judges The Board of the Guilds can also resolve any disputes or conflicts that arise between the guilds.

Collectively, employees and appointees of the Board such as judges, guards, and officials are known informally as the Guild of the Board. People with suitable skills and loyalty to the Guilds are often identified through the military or civil service every citizen has to go through. There are no guard guild or such, as these are the responsibility of the Board. 

This system could ensure that the most powerful and influential merchants and artisans have a greater say in the decision-making process of the Siblíns, and it could also provide an incentive for these merchants and artisans to pay their taxes in order to gain more influence and power. However, this system could also lead to corruption and inequality, as the wealthiest and most powerful merchants could use their money and influence to gain even more power and control over the Siblíns.

## Tax system

### Guild Fees
Every Siblín citizen must join and maintain membership in one of the trade guilds. Fees collected include:
- Entry Fee: upfront payment when initially joining a guild, varying based on the guild's prestige.
- Annual Dues: yearly flat rate paid to the guild, re-evaluated annually based on operating costs.
- Percentage Fees: Many guilds take a set percentage of members' business earnings/income.
### Head Tax
In addition to guild dues, the guilds are tasked with collecting an annual Head Tax from each of their members on behalf of the Board of Guilds. This per capita tax is paid directly to the Board.
### Tariffs and Import Fees
For goods imported through Siblín ports, the Board directly assesses tariffs and customs duties based on the type of resource and country of origin. These fees are paid by merchants before shipments enter the country.

### Guild Contributions to the Board 
The primary revenue source for funding the Board's bureaucracy comes from contributions paid by each guild, as a proportion of their revenue. The amount a guild pays to the Board annually determines how many representative seats that guild receives on the ruling Board of Guilds.

Wealthier, more profitable guilds can choose to pay higher contributions to secure greater representation and legislative power within the Board's governance. Poorer guilds pay less but have less influence over policies.

Overall, the tax system architecture encourages the most successful guilds to buy into greater control, while the Board benefits from taxing imports, collecting head taxes channelled through guilds, and receiving scaled contributions for representation. It maintains multiple reinforcing revenue streams while putting the onus of taxation primarily on guilds rather than directly on businesses or citizens.
## Entry into Siblín territory
Although the Siblíns are diverse, they have grown more protective over the years. No one is allowed to enter the Siblíns without a member of the Guilds who vouches for them. This could be a business partner, an employer, or a service provider for example. Harbours are patrolled by guards and other officials, who enforce the strict rules and regulations governing who can enter and what can be brought in, checking paperwork and credentials.
