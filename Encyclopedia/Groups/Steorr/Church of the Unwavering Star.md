organisation directing the worphsip of the [[Unwavering Star]] 

Their religious symbol is an eight-pointed star. The church of the Unwavering Star is an important faction within the Kingdom and the religion is used as a motivation to expand.

The state religion of [[Steorr|Steorr]] and its colony is the worship of the Unwavering Star, a dark celestial body . 
The Church of the Unwavering Star is an influential institution within the Kingdom. [[Steorr|Steorr]] wants to extend its colonies and enforce worship of the Star.

The Star shines above the city of Star Point. By following it in the sky, explorers from the [[Steorr]] discovered the Islands. The discovery of this land of plenty was seen as proof that the Star was on [[Steorr|Steorr]]'s side

The Kingdom of Steorr is looking to convert the indigenous people of the archipelago to their religion or ideology. The colony could be used as a base for missionaries, who would seek to spread the kingdom's beliefs and practices among the native inhabitants.

## Ideas for the Church (design notes)

#ai
## Core theology
- The Star’s Will: the Unwavering Star is not a person but is believed to bear an inscrutable Will that calls the faithful to order, labor, truth, and courage; doctrine holds that the Star neither moves nor speaks, yet righteousness aligns lives to its fixed light. [3lll
- The Concord of Virtues: seven lived obligations—Order, Duty, Work, Truth, Mercy, Discipline, and Courage—are bound in a public “Concord” that believers renew at milestones, with Astron upheld as the first to bind himself to this covenant. [1][2]
- Grace by Alignment: “grace” is received as alignment to the Star’s Will through oaths, honest craft, and steadfast care of neighbor; miracles are taught as fruits of faith and right order rather than spectacle. [1][4]

## Church vocabulary
- Keep “saint,” add: “Confessor of the Star” for non‑martyr exemplars, “Concordant” for lay leaders, “Flame‑bearers” for royally commissioned servants of law and mercy, “Star‑bound” for the vowed. [1][2]
- Offices already in use—Starwarden, Starkeepers, Starshapers, Starbringers, Starwatchers—become the normative hierarchy across regions, with formal address as “Your Radiance” or “Your Splendour.” [5]
- Law-language: “Concord Law,” “Star Courts,” and “Circuits” (itinerant judges/teachers) distinguish church‑civic life from bishopric/diocese terminology. [2][6]

## Calendar and fasts
- Use the Steorrian calendar: eight‑day weeks, eight months, plus Star Week and cyclical Star Day; appoint high days to each saint and key covenants. [2]
- Major feasts: First Concord Day (Astron), Forgefast (Weland), Black Horizon Watch (Brenna), Hallow’s Vigil (Rochel), Ember of Roemeg (Saulina), Corona Fast (Dorian), Ironridge Stand (Heorstan), Scriptoria Day (Cyridith). [1][2]

## Daily offices
- “Hours of the Fixed Light”: eight short offices per day—Vestdag Praise, Norvest Rule, Nordag Labor, Norost Study, Ostdag Alms, Sorost Discipline, Sordag Mercy, Sorvest Vigil—each pairing prayer with a concrete act. [2]
- Each Hour closes with the Sign of the Eight (tracing an eight‑pointed star) and a spoken Concord clause, not a creed of propositions. [2]

## Liturgy and sacraments‑analogues
- Binding: initiation by oil and ash under a star‑oculus, with a Concord cord cinched at the wrist to “bind in the Light.” [7]
- Shared Table of Toil: a commonmeal rite using plain bread and water warmed over coals, blessed as the fruit of honest labor to sustain the Concord. [1]
- Reckonings: confession as a weekly “reckoning” of kept and broken obligations, sealed by restitution tasks and service assignments. [1]
- Concord Marriage: couples tie a twelve‑strand cord with a thirteenth loose thread “for work yet to be done,” echoing concordarian law. [2]

## Iconography
- Halos out, coronas in: saints are ringed with an eight‑rayed corona; smaller rays mark lay exemplars in murals and seals. [1]
- Astron: Hardblade sheathed and a covenant scroll; Weland: anvil and shard‑tongs; Brenna: empty helm, star‑compass, and a lone returning hull; Rochel: unclosing wound and Hallow at her heel. [1][4]
- Saulina: a veiled gaze and a fire‑tongue scroll; Dorian: plain iron circlet and a watcher’s chain; Heorstan: broken hilt and bridge‑keystones; Cyridith: tablets and ash‑quills. [1][4]

## Architecture
- Star‑plan churches: octagonal naves with a high oculus for the Unwavering Star; a stone “Concord ring” encircles the chancel where oaths are sworn. [7]
- Work‑choirs: refectory‑workshops and scriptoria attached to sanctuaries so worship and labor are visibly one life. [7]
- Pilgrim axes: routes to Star Point Cathedral, Landfall’s Chapel of First Light, Ferngate’s Last Vigil, and sites tied to each saint’s acts. [7]

## Processions, vows, gestures
- Procession of the Unseen Flame: a night march with covered lanterns; lamps are unveiled at the final prayer as a sign that light is borne by the faithful. [1]
- The Bow of Burden: right hand to brow (mind under watch), left to chest (will to labor), then outward (duty to neighbor). [1]
- The Oath of the Eight: recited on feast eves, concluding with a single chime and the Sign of the Eight. [2]

## Saint‑specific rites
- Astron: “Covenant of the Twelve and One” for rulers and magistrates; a civic oath impressed with the Concord seal at Star Point. [6][7]
- Weland: “Hands of Tempering,” a blessing of tools; apprentices present their first useful work, not a masterwork. [1]
- Brenna: “Watch of the Third Dawn,” three‑morning vigil for voyagers; a lone bell is rung for those who “go forward.” [1]
- Rochel: “The Unclosed Vigil,” clinics keep a lamp burning three nights during plague or siege; carers wash hands in scented oil before rounds. [1][4]
- Saulina: “The Ember Reading,” missionaries recite the truth they fear most to speak, then proclaim a psalm of courage in the open square. [1]
- Dorian: “Taking the Weight,” penitents rest a light iron hoop on the brow during silent prayer, returning it when they accept a discipline of service. [6]
- Heorstan: “Bridgewatch,” guardians stand paired at a gate with broken hilts on feast day, renewing vows to hold until relieved. [1]
- Cyridith: “Scriptoria Lay,” judges and scribes copy a single clause by hand before adjudication, binding verdicts to clarity and mercy. [1]

## Law, labor, and mercy
- Work as worship: guilds and households present a “Week’s Portion” of honest craft to the poor at Ostdag, framing charity as ordered justice. [2]
- Order with tenderness: Star Courts pair a magistrate and a caregiver; sentences aim at restitution, not spectacle, and conclude with Concord renewal. [2]

## Pilgrimage and relic praxis
- Pilgrims wear simple eight‑knot cords, adding a knot at each station visited and untying one when a vow is fulfilled. [7]
- Relics emphasize tools and texts over bones: scabbards, anvils, compasses, collars, veils, circlets, keystones, tablets—handled with gloves and set to civic work on high days. [1][4]

## Distinct tone guardrails
- Always attribute wonder to faithful alignment and communal vow, never to “how the Star works,” and keep clergy speech in covenantal, legal, and craft idioms rather than metaphysical proofs. [1][5]
- Center public rites on oaths, ledgers, tools, and lamps so the Church reads as a people under a fixed light who make good on promises in law, labor, and neighbor‑care. [2][7]
