The Kingdom of Steorr is a one of the most powerful countries in the world, located on the continent now known as [[Old Lands]]. In the Islands, the name Steorr is often used to refer to its Colony, that it established thanks to its technological prowess. The citizens of Steorr are of various races that include Humans, Halflings, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs.

## History
The history of Steorr is deeply linked with the [[Unwavering Star]]. It is said that Astron, the son of one of the ancient warring clans of the [[Old Lands]], was born on the same day as the Star appeared in the sky. Thanks to his family's belief in his prophetic nature, military might, and diplomatic acumen, he united a multitude of clans under his rule and became known as King Astron the Unifier, the first king of Steorr and the first saint of the [[Church of the Unwavering Star]]. The year 35 SL, when the last human kingdom bent the knee, is considered the establishment of the Kingdom of Steorr. Territorial expansion continued over the next centuries, bringing much of the eastern seaboard under Steorrian control and solidifying the Kingdom as the dominant force on the continent.

In 1028 SL, an expedition was launched across the ocean in pursuit of the Unwavering Star. This voyage led to the discovery of the archipelago that became known as the Islands the following year. Drawn by warm climates, turquoise waters, and plentiful natural resources, more daring Steorrians flocked to the Islands. Thanks to a powerful navy and advanced technology, settlers from the Kingdom easily established themselves on the Grand Isle, Crater Isle, and Jagged Isle, forming the Colony of Steorr. Native inhabitants were either assimilated or displaced under Steorrian authority.

Today, the Kingdom continues to spread its influence from the mainland to holdings across the Islands. However, tensions simmer with rival powers and within the Colony itself. 

## Government
Steorr is a monarchy ruled by King Ferrin III from the royal palace in the capital city of Hafensted. The monarch holds absolute power and claims to rule by divine right of the Unwavering Star.

Steorrian society is organised into a class hierarchy. Noble houses rule over provinces in the king's name and must furnish soldiers and taxes to support the crown. The [[Church of the Unwavering Star]] and its clergy wield considerable influence over policies. Merchants and professionals form a growing middle class, while peasants and laborers have the lowest status.

The monarch appoints a royal governor who administers the colony on the Crown's behalf. This governor has broad executive powers subject to oversight from the homeland. Taxes and levies are collected by the colonial government and a portion flows back to the royal treasury. The governor corresponds with the monarch. However, communication can be sporadic as the the sea voyage lasts for months.

## Culture
Steorrians are composed of multiple races, including elves, dwarves, and humans, united under their expansionist, colonial mindset. They have a religious commitment to the Unwavering Star, a deity representing order, law, and authority. Their society is hierarchical, militaristic, and expansionist, with a sense of moral superiority over conquered peoples.

Steorrian society values order, industry, and exploration. Art, architecture, traditions, and stories are largely shaped by these principles. Ritual celebrations, marked by grand feasts, infuse vibrancy into daily routines. These communal events serve not only as occasions for merriment but also as expressions of the Kingdom's collective identity, all under the watchful gaze of the Unwavering Star.

The Church is a powerful institution within the Kingdom that acts as both custodian and interpreter of the Star’s will. Its teachings and doctrines guide the faithful, instilling a deep-seated belief in the divine connection between the Star and the destiny of Steorr. The Church generally sees magic as profane and an affront to the order established by the Star. The few people who are wield it are often seen with fear and distrust and blamed for all sort of evils. While not outright illegal, the use of magic is an aggravating circumstance for other perceived offences.

The desire to spread the Star’s message and Steorrian values have been instrumental in the Kingdom's ascent to prominence and expansion to the Islands. Magic being much more common in the Islands as it is in the Old Lands has caused tensions between Steorr and native inhabitants, who often practice magic openly. The Kingdom views cultural influences from Islanders as primitive and corrupting forces that could threaten Steorrian identity.

## Foreign relations in the Islands

Clashing ideals, religious differences, past wars, and thirst for resources stoke tensions between Steorr and other entities in the archipelago. 

Steorr views its ambitions in the Islands as a righteous undertaking to uplift primitive cultures and uses assimilation, religious conversion, and military power to expand. 

After years of war, Steorr still mistrusts the elves of Selvea due to their magic, military might, and superior knowledge of the land. Although trade has soothed suspicions of the Siblín Guilds, Steorr remains weary of the wealth and economic influence the Siblín Guilds wield.
