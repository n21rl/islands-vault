The Steorrian Island Colony operates under a complex administrative structure designed to govern its territories effectively. This system is characterized by a clear hierarchy and significant consolidation of power among key officials.

1. Colonial Level

At the apex of the colonial administration sits the Governor of the Steorrian Island Colony. Appointed directly by the Steorrian monarch, the Governor wields broad executive powers and is responsible for the overall administration of the entire colonial territory. The Governor resides in New Bæcon, the colonial capital on the Grand Isle.

The Governor corresponds with the monarch and royal council, providing updates on colonial affairs and receiving directives. They oversee the collection of taxes and levies, ensuring a portion flows back to the royal treasury in Steorr.

2. Island Level

Beneath the Governor are the Stewards, one for each major island under Steorrian control:

- Steward of Grand Isle
- Steward of Jagged Isle
- Steward of Crater Isle

The role of Steward is largely symbolic. They represent the crown's authority on their respective islands but have limited practical administrative powers. Stewards serve as figureheads and liaisons between the island's population and the colonial government.

3. Provincial Level

The practical administration of larger islands falls to the Prefects. Each Prefect is responsible for governing a specific region or province within an island. Examples include:

- Prefect of Western Grand Isle
- Prefect of Eastern Grand Isle
- Prefect of Northern Jagged Isle
- Prefect of Southern Jagged Isle

4. City Level

At the local level, Mayors govern individual cities and large towns. Key examples include:

- Mayor of New Bæcon
- Mayor of Star Point
- Mayor of Sealtham

Mayors are responsible for the day-to-day governance of their respective urban centers, answering to the higher levels of colonial administration.

Power Consolidation

A key feature of this administrative structure is the consolidation of power, where individuals often hold multiple titles and responsibilities across different levels of governance. For example:

- The Governor also serves as:
  - Prefect of the Old Coast province on the Grand Isle
  - Mayor of New Bæcon

- The Mayor of Star Point also serves as:
  - Prefect of the Point province in Eastern Grand Isle

- The Mayor of Sealtham doubles as:
  - Prefect of the Salt Peaks province in the Jagged Isle

This consolidation of titles streamlines governance and concentrates authority, reducing the number of individual power centers and allowing for more efficient decision-making.

Hierarchy:

Governor of the Steorrian Island Colony
↓
Stewards of Islands (symbolic roles)
↓
Prefects of Provinces
↓
Mayors of Cities

It's important to note that while this hierarchy exists, the consolidation of roles means that in practice, the lines between these levels can be blurred, with powerful individuals wielding authority across multiple levels simultaneously.

Territorial Extent

Steorrian control is primarily concentrated on three main islands:
- Grand Isle
- Jagged Isle
- Crater Isle

This administrative framework provides the Steorrian Island Colony with a clear chain of command while allowing for the concentration of power necessary to govern a diverse and geographically dispersed colonial territory.

Certainly! Let's break down the responsibilities for each level of administration in more detail:

1. Governor of the Steorrian Island Colony
Responsibilities:
- Implementing overall colonial policy as directed by the Crown
- Coordinating between the colony and the homeland
- Managing relations with other colonial powers and major native groups
- Overseeing the colonial budget and major economic decisions
- Making final decisions on colony-wide laws and regulations
- Commanding the colonial military forces
- Appointing Stewards and other high-level officials

2. Steward of [Island Name]
Responsibilities:
- Overseeing the administration of their entire island or island group
- Implementing the Governor's policies at the island level
- Managing island-specific resources and industries
- Coordinating between different provinces on their island
- Handling island-level disputes and legal matters
- Overseeing island-specific infrastructure projects
- Managing relations with local native groups
- Reporting to the Governor on the state of their island

3. Prefect of [Province Name]
Responsibilities:
- Administering a specific region within a larger island
- Enforcing colonial and island-level laws and regulations
- Managing local resources and overseeing smaller-scale industries
- Collecting taxes and maintaining financial records for their province
- Overseeing local infrastructure and development projects
- Resolving local disputes and maintaining order
- Coordinating with mayors of cities within their province
- Reporting to their island's Steward

4. Mayor of [City Name]
Responsibilities:
- Governing a specific city or large town
- Managing city services (e.g., sanitation, local law enforcement)
- Overseeing city-specific laws and regulations
- Managing the city budget and local taxes
- Coordinating with the local Prefect on larger issues
- Representing the city's interests to higher levels of government
- Handling day-to-day administration and citizen concerns

This structure allows for a clear division of responsibilities while also creating potential areas of overlap and conflict. For example:

- A Steward might disagree with the Governor about how to implement a particular policy on their island.
- A Prefect might struggle to balance the demands of their Steward with the needs of the mayors in their province.
- A Mayor might petition the Prefect or even the Steward directly for resources or support, potentially causing tension.

These intersections of authority and responsibility can create interesting dynamics for your campaign, allowing for political maneuvering, conflicting loyalties, and complex decision-making at all levels of colonial administration.
