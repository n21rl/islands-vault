campaign: "[[A Province on the Edge]]"
---
Hi players! I'm looking to run an Age of Sail-inspired sandbox-style D&D campaign, with collaborative storytelling and dynamic worldbuilding at an inclusive table. 

## A province on the edge

*About 150 years ago, settlers from the distant Kingdom of Steorr made landfall in the warm, resource-rich archipelago known as the Islands. They began spreading their worship of the Unwavering Star and mistrust of magic.* 
*This expansion brought Steorr into direct conflict with Selvea, an elven empire with deep ties to the archipelago and rituals honoring a pantheon of nature deities.* 
*After decades of intermittent wars, an uneasy peace was reached 14 years ago, with Steorr ceding the province of the Jaw to Selvea.* 
*This region, framed by mountains and sea, is now a mosaic of peoples, faiths, and cultures. Steorrians, Selveans, indigenous and foreign people coexist there, under the rule of the Selvean Envoy tasked with preserving the fragile peace in this unique place.*

*In this campaign, surrounded by various factions with competing interests, the characters will see their choices shape not only their own stories but also the future of the Jaw.*
