## Introduction

This simplified version of Dungeons & Dragons is designed for young players around age 7. It keeps the core structure of the official rules (ability modifiers, armor class, d20 rolls, spell slots) so it’s familiar and easy to run for adults who know 5e.

The complexity is reduced through visuals, limited choices, and streamlined mechanics, but the core gameplay remains intact. Players focus on imagination, decisions, and storytelling, without needing to track stats or memorize rules.

It’s an ideal way to introduce kids to D&D while keeping the system comfortable for experienced GMs.

## Health and Damage

- Use hearts (❤️) to represent HP
- 1 ❤️ = 4 HP  
- Damage and healing are tracked in hearts (divide by 4 and round up)  
- Track hearts visually with tokens, counters, or fillable shapes 

## Abilities

- Six abilities, grouped into:
	- Body 🏃‍➡️: 
		- Strength 💪
		- Agility 🖐️ (Dexterity)
		- Toughness ❤️‍🩹 (Constitution) 
	- Mind 🧠 : 
		- Thinking 💭 (Intelligence)
		- Senses 👁️ (Wisdom)
		- Voice 🗨️ (Charisma)
- Assign modifiers using an array like +3, +2, +1, 0, 0, -1  
- Use modifiers only for everything: ; no full ability scores or skill lists  

## Armor and AC

- Use standard D&D AC values  
- Shields add +2 AC  
- Armor types are simplified and described clearly (AC and stealth penalties)  

## Classes




## Combat
- Roll a d20 + ability modifier to hit  
- A successful hit deals a number of heart in damage  
- Monsters follow the same rule: fixed heart-based damage  
- Initiative can be simplified (e.g. table order or player first)  

## Skill Checks
- Roll a d20 + ability modifier to try something exciting or risky  
- Use simple difficulty examples:  
  - 5 = easy  
  - 10 = normal  
  - 15 = hard  
  - 20 = very hard  
- Explain advantage/disadvantage as “roll twice, take better/worse”  
- Only roll when the outcome is uncertain and interesting  

## Spellcasting

- Spells unlock at level 2
- Use stars or checkboxes to track spell slots  
- Each spell costs 1 star to use  
- Spells deal fixed heart damage or have clear effects  
- Spell slots recharge after a rest  
- See [[spellcasting]], [[spell slots]], [[resting]]

## Gold and Equipment

- Track gold as coins  
- Prices are simplified: divide standard gp prices by 10 and round  
- Most basic gear is free or bundled into themed packs  
- Limit inventory to 3–5 items to avoid overload  

## Pets and Allies

- Optional pet or ally slots  
- Represent with emoji, tokens, or short descriptions  
- Simple traits like “warns you of danger” or “helps sniff treasure”  


## Character Sheet
- Use laminated or printed sheets with space for:  
  - Fillable hearts  
  - Spell stars  
  - Gold circles  
  - Inventory slots  
  - Drawing frame for character art  
- Designed for wet/dry erase marker use  
- See [[character sheet]]

## Session and Play Tips

- Use visual tools like tokens, spell cards, and drawings  
- Emphasize choices, imagination, and character growth  
- Simplify monsters (1–3 hearts, 1 attack, 1 trick)  
- Rule fast and keep the focus on story and fun  



These rules preserve he spirit of 5e while making it accessible, visual, and story-driven for a 7-year-old player.



## 🎲 Core System Overview

This system is built to feel like real D&D—but streamlined and visual, with limited math, no jargon, and meaningful choices. It’s designed for a 7-year-old but is flexible enough to grow with the player.



## ❤️ Health and Damage

- **1 heart = 4 HP** (rounded up from any standard source)
- Characters and monsters track health in **hearts**
- Damage is converted to hearts (rounded up)
- At **0 hearts**, a character is **unconscious**
- No death saves, just narrative resolution
- Healing restores hearts directly



## ✋ Abilities

Six ability stats, grouped into two categories:

### Body

- **Strength** (💪): hitting, lifting, breaking
- **Agility** (🖐️): dodging, sneaking, moving
- **Toughness** (❤️‍🩹): resisting, enduring, staying up

### Mind

- **Thinking** (💭): solving, planning, learning
- **Sense** (👁️): noticing, feeling, healing
- **Expression** (🗨️): talking, leading, performing

**Modifiers** only are used. Common spread: +3, +2, +1, 0, 0, -1  
No skill list—ability checks cover everything.



## 🛡️ Armor and AC

- AC is kept from official armor rules (e.g. chainmail = 16)
- Shield = +2 AC
- Heavy armor may limit Agility (DM decides case-by-case)
- Stealth penalties can be described narratively



## ⚔️ Combat

- Roll **d20 + relevant ability modifier** to hit
- Player characters deal **1 heart damage** on a hit
- Monster attacks are simplified similarly
- No attacks of opportunity (and no disengage)
- No bonus action
- **Dash** action allows moving twice as much
- Initiative can be DM-decided (table order, monsters after players, etc.)
- **Movement is tracked in squares**



## 🎯 Checks and DCs

- **DCs**: 5 (easy), 10 (normal), 15 (hard), 20 (very hard)
- Only roll when something is risky or interesting
- Advantage/disadvantage can be explained situationally (e.g. "Roll twice, take the better/worse")
- Conditions are **not explained up front**—only the effect is described when it happens



## ✨ Magic

- **No spells at level 0**
- At level 1, characters may access magic based on their class
- All spells (even simple ones) **cost a spell slot** (called **stars**)
- There is **no distinction** between cantrips and leveled spells
- Each magic user has a **limited number of stars** that recharge on a **long rest**
- **Spell names are simplified** for child clarity

### Types of Magic (based on abilities):

- **Thinking magic (💭)**: clever, elemental, studied (e.g. fire, force, control)
- **Sense magic (👁️)**: natural, healing, spiritual (e.g. plants, animals, cure)
- **Expression magic (🗨️)**: emotional, performative, tricky (e.g. illusion, charm, thunder)

### Non-caster access:

- A character can take a **Magic Initiate–style feat** to gain a few spells using adapted rules (with 1 or 2 stars)



## 🔁 Rest and Recovery

- **Only long rests exist**
- Long rest restores **all hearts, stars, and abilities**
- No short rests



## 🧰 Inventory and Items

- No item slots—**inventory is based on common sense**
- Assume characters carry only what makes sense for their size and story
- Prices are simplified by dividing standard D&D gp prices by 10 and rounding



## 🪙 Feats and Customization

- Players can receive a **feat at level 0 or 1** based on concept
- The DM either selects an official feat to adapt or creates one
- Feats can give:
    - A special action or reroll
    - A spell slot or ability
    - A bonus to a check or stat



## 📈 Leveling

- **Milestone leveling**—not XP-based
- Typically: **1 level per session**, or after major story progress
