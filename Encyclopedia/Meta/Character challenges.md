I'm going to develop some _character challenges_ for the time between sessions. The idea is to explore your characters in different ways, away from the table. If you complete the challenge before the next session, you'll get extra _inspiration_ (it will stack). No pressure if you don't want to participate, this will be completely optional.

## Character challenge: Symbols
For each of the following rubrics, give use something you feel represents your character. You can explain your reasoning if you want.

1. **Colour**: A colour your character likes or wears. Or a colour that represents their vibe
2. **Emoji**: An emoji they look like, or one that captures their spirit
3. **GIF**: Could be a short video that depicts a situation they'd be in, a mood, etc.
4. **Famous Words**: A mantra, a quote, a personal catchphrase that defines your character
5. **Spirit Animal**: A creature that mirrors your character's nature, or that they would have as a pet

## Character challenge: Portrait
Let’s see what your character actually looks like! This challenge is about creating a visual representation of your PC, as close as you can get. 

A few mediums you could use:
- Drawing or painting
- Hero Forge miniature
- Video game character creator (RPGs, The Sims, etc.)
- Online avatar maker (Picrew, etc.)
- LEGO minifig
- Detailed text description
- Any other ideas?

Don't just grab an image online, we'll have a challenge for that later. This is about _creating_ a version of your character!

## Character challenge: Fears and Dreams
We're diving deep for this one!
What are you character's deepest fears? What are their dearest dreams? Not just what's on their mind at the moment, but the existential stuff.
Ideally try to share at least one fear and one dream. . But if you're really stuck on one side, feel free to offer more from the other.

As this challenge is a bit more personal than the others, send it to me in your private PC channel.

## Character Challenge: Mood Board
Create a mood board that captures your character’s vibe: what they look like, what they feel like, what matters to them, etc. 
This challenge about evoking aesthetic, emotion and atmosphere through a collection of visuals.

Find or create images of:
- Objects
- Places
- Colours
- Scenes
- People and animals
- Textures and materials
- Text snippets
- etc. 

Use whatever tool works for you (e.g. Canva, Pinterest, Slides, Photoshop) or just drop a bunch of images here.

## Character challenge: Use your words
Let’s hear your character in their own voice!
Write a short piece (just a paragraph or two) of something your character might have written, said, or thought. It could come from any moment in their life: during the campaign or before it began.

A few ideas:
- A diary entry
- A letter (sent or mot)
- A prayer or invocation
- A song or poem
- A story
- A speech
- An internal monologue

Depending on what you write, feel free to share it here or send it in your private PC channel if you prefer.

## Other ideas

### Character challenge: Social Media Profile

Build a fantasy social profile:

- Username, tagline, stats, likes/dislikes
- What do you _want_ others to see?
- What’s clearly a lie—or suspiciously missing?

### Character challenge: Objects

Pick 3 personal items they carry:

- One is broken.
- One was stolen.
- One is a secret.

### Character challenge: Future Echo

They see a glimpse of themselves in 10 years. What do they look like? Are they alone?
