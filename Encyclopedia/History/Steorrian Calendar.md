The Steorrian calendar starts in year 1, the first spring after the appearance of the Unwavering Star. The era before the appearance of the Star is referred to as the Darkness, while the era after is considered Starlit.

The year is composed of 328 days, divided into 8 months of five 8-day weeks, as well as an extra week called Star Week that sits at the end of the year.

The 8 months of Veran, Veroth, Sumaran, Sumaroth, Haustan, Haustoh, Gieman, Giemoth go in pairs that form seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). 

The 8 days of the week are called Vestdag, Norvest, Nordag, Norost, Ostdag, Sorost, Sordag, Sorvest. 

Starting in year 8, every 8 years, an additional day referred to as Star Day is added before the beginning of the year to account for calendar drift.
