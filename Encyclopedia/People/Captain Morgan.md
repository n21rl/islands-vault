Captain Morgan is the leader of [[The Drunks]], one of the founders of the [[Republic|Republic]] and its most powerful captain. He is a charismatic and cunning man who was once a privateer for the [[Steorr|Steorrian Crown]], raiding [[Selvea (city)|Selvean]] targets. He turned to piracy after the end of the war, feeling betrayed by his former employer. He is a master of strategy and tactics, and has a reputation for being ruthless and daring.
