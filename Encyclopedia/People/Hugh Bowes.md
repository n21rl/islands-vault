Hugh Bowes is a Half-Elf merchant from [[Steorr]]. He has ties to the [[Green Salt Trading Company]]. 

He was the owner of the Arrow, the ship captained by [[Orguk]]. During a trip to [[Áine]], the Orc led a mutiny against Bowes, which led to the discovery of secret magic items in the hold. 

The ship was attacked by a sea monster and several ship occupants found themselves on an [[Fort Island]]. After trying to get the part to recover his cargo from the rest of the crew, Bowes was left stranded. 

He somehow made his way to [[Sealtham]] where the adventures saw him in discussion with [[Lord Mayor Brummbär]].
