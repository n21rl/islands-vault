## Description
A respected elder with connections to both Selvean and Steorrian communities, Granny Moon is a steadfast advocate for coexistence in a region fraught with tensions. She runs an orphanage and is a matriarchal figure to [[Harboursjaw]]’s most vulnerable residents.
## Personality
Wise, sharp-tongued, and firm, she commands respect across divides but isn’t afraid to scold or call out bad behaviour. Her moral authority and deep understanding of local dynamics make her a force for peace.
## Role
- Mediates conflicts, such as the altercation at the Selvean altar, where her intervention defuses escalating tensions.
- Provides shelter and safety, offering Biggs and Lanternhead a place to stay in the orphanage’s basement after the Purists protest.
## Significance
- Her presence symbolises the possibility of reconciliation in Harboursjaw, balancing her Jawist sympathies with practical wisdom.
- Her murder in Session 3 will likely serve as a pivotal event, shaking the community and forcing characters to confront the fragile peace she worked to maintain.
