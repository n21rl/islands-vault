Mokunaro is an elderly male [[Hakari Sea Elves|Hakari]] sea elf living in the [[Undercity]] of [[Áine]]. His pale blue skin is wrinkled and marked with sacred Hakari tattoos. His long, silvery-white hair is tied back in intricate braids, adorned with small shells and coral beads. Mokunaro's eyes are a striking shade of turquoise, holding a depth of knowledge and a hint of sorrow.

A spiritual leader with the Matakite title, he was known for his strict adherence to Hakari traditions and his unwavering devotion to the god Tanawhu. He believed firmly in the importance of maintaining the tribe's purity and often spent long periods in isolation, meditating and communing with his god.

However, Mokunaro's rigid beliefs brought him into conflict with Tohunga Kahwra, another respected leader. The Hakari had attacked a human merchant vessel, sacrificing the adults to Tanawhu as was their custom. But amidst the carnage, Kahwra discovered a hidden baby, the infant Kaihakan. Unable to bring herself to sacrifice the child, Kahwra made the controversial decision to adopt him and raise him as Hakari under the name Kaihakan. This choice divided the tribe's elders, with Mokunaro being the most vocal opponent. He saw Kaihakan's inclusion as a threat to the Hakari way of life and a cause of Tanawhu's displeasure. Eventually, unable to sway Kahwra or the other elders, Mokunaro chose to set out on long retreats, rarely interacting with his tribe.

It was during this self-imposed exile that the Hakari Isles were destroyed, and the entire tribe seemingly wiped out. Grief-stricken, Mokunaro wandered the seas, eventually finding his way to Áine in the Siblín Islands after receiving a dream from Tanawhu who told him he would meet a new champion there. In Áine, Mokunaro faced discrimination due to his Hakari heritage and found himself an outcast. It was the Guildless, a diverse community of misfits living in the Undercity, who took Mokunaro in. Among them, he found a new sense of belonging and purpose, using his knowledge of Hakari divination and spiritual practices to guide and advise his new community. However, he never forgot his roots or the secrets he carried. 

He manage to convert three young elves: Tuatahi, Tuarua, Tuatoru (Tuawha would be fourth)
His dialogue style is very Lovecraftian and senile.

Impure one 
Kawhras folly 

First Meeting:
"You profane the hallowed bloodwriting of our lost tribe with your landstrider stain, whelp! Those sacred markings were never meant to adorn an outlander's heathen flesh."

"While our people endured the abyssal profanation of the drowned isles' obliteration, the surface-worlders festered and delivered ingrates like you into our decimated legacy."

"I should flay the idolatrous alien-inks from your body with riptooth scourges, blasphemer - for no trueborn Hakari would allow such defilement of our cultic signatures!"

Reminiscing:
"Your sacrilegious adoption is a stain upon all we sacred few survived...the rending oblivions that extinguished our hallowed homeland and ways."

"Can you even begin to comprehend the cosmic magnitudes our profane rites and liturgical pararchies once commanded, before your misshapen kind diluted the oceans' truth?"

"Our people's unreconciled truths were sirened from the event horizons shearing off unmapped cosmic deeps - not sprung from some lander's guttertribe interpretation!"

Visions of Kai's Role:
"And yet...even as I prepare to unmake you, the graven pathways of my latest visionbirth scrawl an incontrovertible signal bearing some semblance of your lurching profanity."

"I have tasted the sickening otherwhere realities where Tanawhu's infinite blasphemies may yet require your dislocated nature as some egregore of their material incarnation!"

"An ill omen amidst my chitterings with the anti-cosmic magisters, perhaps - or the very cosmic ignition our dread oblivion has awaited since the first forbidden ley-equations unfurled."

Acceptance of Kai:
"No matter the profane and implausible vessel, the Unfurled One's ultimate unburthening upon this unfinished reality simply requires an earthly celebrant to usher in its materialization."

"Attend me well, landspawn claimant to the Hakari's profane heritage. For I have at long last received the abyssal verification that you are to be LurkedSpawn's harbinger!"  

"My ancient huskmind has beheld the coming unravel'd certitudes gestating in your grotesque, ill-fit embodiment, child. You and I shall be nightgale revelers as Tanawhu remakes all worlds!"

"Let our unholy peregrination unto the ultimate null/reality's profane investiture begin, squidspawn! For too long has the cosmic renewal festered in unborn parallel deeps, awaiting its profane vector!"
