Neverins Augusta Eason is [[Norimor Eason]] twin sister and upholder of tradition and etiquette. She maintains her position leading the Printer's Guild through shrewd maneuvering. 

A severe, thin-lipped woman, Neverins keeps her iron grey hair tightly pinned under a lace cap. Her wrinkled visage bears a perpetual dour expression as she surveys surroundings for any impropriety. Neverins wears elegant high-collared gowns with rows of pearl buttons and brooches. 

Neverins scrutinizes people over her beak-like nose, immediately noticing any breach in manners or decorum. She clutches her ornate ebony cane tightly and nods curtly when addressing anyone, even her dear brother. Neverins voices strong opinions on social mores in an articulate, precise tone.
