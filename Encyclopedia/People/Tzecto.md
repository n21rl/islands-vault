Tzecto, the Champion-General of the Jaw, is the highest-ranking Selvean military leader in the region, commanding the Champions and overseeing both the Blood Path and Spirit Path warriors. A figure of immense martial skill and strategic brilliance, he is both feared and respected, embodying the might of Selvea in a land still torn by tensions and conflict.

### Appearance & Presence

Tzecto is a towering figure, standing well above most elves, with a body honed by years of combat. His dark bronze skin is marked with ritual scars, each carved with precision, signifying victories, oaths, and the burdens of command. These scars, filled with dark ink, are more than decorations—they are records of his dedication to Selvea’s cause.

His dark brown hair, thick and wavy, is woven into long battle braids, adorned with obsidian and jade beads. These braids grow longer with each campaign he leads, a tradition among high-ranking Selvean warriors. His face is sharp and angular, with a strong, square jaw, high cheekbones, and piercing amber eyes that burn with intensity. His gaze is known to unsettle both allies and enemies alike, for it is the look of a man who weighs everything—every move, every flaw, every possible betrayal.

Tzecto wears a suit of reinforced leather and metal, darkened with volcanic ash and streaked with ceremonial etchings of war glyphs. Across his broad shoulders, a black vulture-feathered mantle drapes, a sign of his authority and a symbol of the battlefield’s ever-watchful eye. On his chest, he wears a simple yet ancient jade pendant, said to be a relic of his family, one of the few things he keeps from his past.

### The Champion-General of the Jaw
Tzecto’s title, Champion-General of the Jaw, grants him full control over all Selvean military forces in the region, including the elite Champions. Though he does not rule other territories, within the Jaw, his authority in matters of war is nearly absolute. His command extends over:

- The Blood Path – Warriors who focus on brute strength, endurance, and physical domination.
- The Spirit Path – Fighters trained in precision, strategy, and magical warfare.

Under his leadership, the Champions have solidified Selvean rule in Harboursjaw, quelling rebellions, maintaining order, and securing the province from external threats. He is not merely a strategist—he fights alongside his warriors, a presence that inspires those who serve under him and terrifies those who oppose him.



### Combat & Strategy

Tzecto is both a master warrior and a ruthless tactician. His personal fighting style blends the sheer power of Blood Path warriors with the calculated precision of the Spirit Path. He wields a macuahuitl, an obsidian-edged war club capable of ripping through armor with a single blow. When in close combat, he strikes with a bone-hilted dagger, a weapon often reserved for ceremonial executions—though in his hands, it is an instrument of deadly efficiency.

As a commander, he is unforgiving but not reckless. His strategies balance overwhelming force with careful planning, ensuring victory with minimal losses to his own side. He does not waste lives for the sake of honor, nor does he tolerate incompetence. His forces are drilled into disciplined, elite warriors, and he expects nothing less than perfection from them.

Despite his discipline, Tzecto is not one to show mercy to his enemies. When he takes action, it is decisive and often brutal. Those who resist Selvean rule in the Jaw have learned that opposing him means not only losing the battle but losing everything.



### Personality & Reputation

Tzecto is a man of few words but immense presence. He does not command through shouting or grand speeches—instead, he speaks deliberately and with finality, his words carrying weight that no one dares question.

He is deeply loyal to Selvea, though some question whether his dedication stems from true belief in the empire or a personal vendetta against Steorrians. His past remains largely unknown, and though rumors swirl about his origins and the reason for his deep hatred of Steorr, he allows no one close enough to confirm the truth.

Among his allies, he is respected but feared. He does not tolerate failure, and those who serve under him know that he does not give second chances. Among his enemies, he is a nightmare—a man who does not simply conquer but ensures that those who rise against him are utterly broken.

The people of the Jaw whisper his name in both awe and dread. To the Selveans, he is their greatest warrior, a symbol of the empire’s unshakable dominance. To the Steorrians, he is a merciless enforcer, the shadow of Selvea’s power looming over them. And to the Jawists and native rebels, he is a storm—a force they cannot yet escape.
