Lou Beluga is the Cetafolk innkeeper of [[The White Straw Hat]] in [[Áine]], [[Siblín Guilds]]. 

His smooth, greyish skin is often sunburnt. A portly man, he dresses in a flamboyant style and has a thin moustache.

Lou's trusting smile, loud barking laugh, gregarious disposition and tendency to break into song make him a popular host.

A friend of [[Yazim]] from [[Bard College]], he distributed [[Hagroot]] for the smuggling ring.
