Hallow was [[Saint Rochel]]'s faithful dog. A tall, broad-chested hound with long limbs, he was an imposing presence moving moved with purpose. His head was squared and elongated, his eyes a deep amber. 
His coarse grey coat with silver streaks thickened around his neck, where a leather collar rested. From this collar, a small wooden cask hung, holding fortified drink.
