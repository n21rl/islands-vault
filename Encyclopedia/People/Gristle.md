## Description
An orc enforcer for the Hammer gang, operating in Harboursjaw. His role involves keeping the gang’s operations running smoothly and enforcing their interests with brute force or manipulation. Butcher
## Personality
Gruff, pragmatic, and loyal to the gang. He’s shrewd enough to coordinate complex schemes but lacks subtlety in his methods.
## Role
- Directs efforts to rig the Champions Tournament in favour of Halron, the red-headed dwarf who has paid the gang for assistance.
- Tasks Vic to protect Halron and ensure he advances in the tournament, bypassing the earlier trials.
- Manipulates Yasmine, an outcast gnome healer, into subtly favouring Halron during combat.
## Significance:
 - Represents the criminal underbelly of Steorrian society and the pervasive corruption that undermines fairness and trust.
 - Highlights the divide between those willing to play by the rules and those who exploit systems for personal gain.
