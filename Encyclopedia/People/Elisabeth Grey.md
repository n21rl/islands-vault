Captain [[Elisabeth Grey]] is the female gnome pirate captain of the [[Grey Phantom]]. Although not a name she uses, people have referred to her crew as [[The Phantoms]]. She has sharp angular features and piercing emerald eyes.

She sailed legitimately for years before turning to piracy when times became hard. Sharp-eyed and sharp-tongue, she had a reputation of treating her hard-working crew members fairly and disparaging the lazy. She was [[Gurt]]'s first captain, who sailed with her for about ten years before she abandoned him on a raid gone wrong. Over the years, she turned harsher and ruthless, attacking defenceless civilian targets. She also became more elusive, sailing through the fog, striking, and disappearing again.

She was held in Cavea for misuse of elemental stone magic.

She is deceptively youthful, not appearing older than 35 despite most likely being in her sixties.

Grey is ruthless yet sentimental about her early sailing days.


Here is an encyclopedia entry summarizing everything we've discussed about the pirate captain Elisabeth Grey:

**Grey, Elisabeth**

Elisabeth Grey is an infamous pirate captain who sails the waters of the Northern Scattered Isles. She commands the pirate crew known as The Phantoms aboard her ship, the Grey Phantom. 

Grey is a gnome woman with sharp, angular facial features and piercing emerald eyes. Despite being potentially over 60 years old, she retains a youthful appearance not much older than 35. 

In her younger days, Grey sailed legitimately before turning to piracy. The dwarf Gurt sailed under her command for nearly a decade on the Grey Phantom before she abandoned him on a failed raid. Since then, she has become a ruthless pirate preying on ships and settlements.

Grey possesses a magical stone attuned to the element of wind, allowing her to control fog. She frequently shrouds her ship and raids in supernatural fog, concealing her presence and mystifying pursuers. Her long exposure to the fog's magic may have fractured her psyche and caused amnesia regarding her past. 

Crew members rarely remain under her service long. Her crew seems to change frequently, with few under her current command recalling past comrades. This contributes to the aura of mystery surrounding Grey.

Legends depict Grey as a mythical fog spirit or goddess, rather than a mortal pirate. She uses illusions to further obfuscate her true nature and origins. Destroying her fog stone may be the key to ending her reign of piracy and unraveling her secrets.

Grey prefers sabotage, subterfuge, and guerilla tactics over direct confrontation. She remains steps ahead of foes through manipulation, spying, and unpredictable actions. When cornered, the fog provides her a tactical advantage, limiting visibility and movement.

Though her motives and history are largely obscured, Grey is undoubtedly a dangerous threat. Her presence spells doom for any unfortunates caught in the phantom fog's cold embrace. The shards of her fractured psyche drive her to ominous ends known only to her. Those who pursue this enigmatic pirate often find tragedy or madness waiting amidst the mist.
