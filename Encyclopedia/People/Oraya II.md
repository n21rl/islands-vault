Born ~84 years ago, when the Steorrian yoke had bent the Jaw to near-breaking.

Oraya II was a child of contradictions.
She was raised in a town where Steorrian tongue ruled the courts and the markets, but the jungle still whispered in the branches outside the palisades.
Her mother, Mira, taught her the manners of trade and prayer expected of a mixed-race merchant’s daughter.
Her father, Veylan, taught her caution: to remember nothing too dangerous, to dream only small dreams.

But Oraya II carried something older, something buried in her marrow.

When Veylan died, she inherited his possessions—mostly junk—but at the bottom of a locked chest she found a woven belt embroidered with fading sigils: relics of a time and a people no longer spoken of.
That discovery broke her carefully laid life open.

Where others forgot, Oraya began to remember.
Where others accepted, she began to ask.
Where others bowed their heads, she began to listen—to the river songs, to the carvings at old shrines, to the bent grandmothers who still muttered in dying dialects.

She became a quiet historian, a memory-keeper.

Not in the grand halls of Steorrian scholars, but in the back rooms of crumbling taverns, among the jawbone fires of half-forgotten villages, across the vine-strangled ruins where the Tetzilwahi mounds once breathed.
She mapped places erased from maps.
She copied songs whispered by trembling old men.
She pieced together names, bloodlines, oaths, rituals.

She hid it all carefully: in stitched cloth, in coded ink, in memory.

She lived between two worlds, never fully trusted by either.
To Steorrians, she was too native, too superstitious.
To Jaw-born resistance cells growing in the jungles, she was too cautious, too academic, not fierce enough.

It did not matter.
Oraya II had one purpose: to preserve what could not be replaced.

As tensions between Steorr and Selvea worsened into open skirmishes, Oraya II moved closer to the wilds, seeking quieter places to work.
It was there, among fugitive communities that she met X, a sharp-eyed tracker. 
They were never formally wed, but together they had a son: Manatu Doltha.

From the beginning, Oraya II knew her son was different.
Where she was cautious, Rilith was reckless.
Where she collected the past, he burned for the future.

She tried to teach him the old songs, the old names.
She tried to show him the value of remembering.
But the boy grew into a world ablaze, and he did not want memory.
He wanted to fight.

When Manatu came of age, he joined the Jaw-born resistance—not the dreamers and historians, but the warriors, the knife-carriers.

Oraya II did not try to stop him.
She knew too well that survival sometimes meant letting go.

She remained behind, continuing her life's work: copying, preserving, hiding, praying that even if the new war consumed her son, some echo of who they had been would survive.

In her sixties, she ventured deep into the jungle of the Jaw to look for the Tetzilwahi ruins.
