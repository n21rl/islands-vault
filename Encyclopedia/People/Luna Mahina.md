Luna Mahina is a prominent figure in the Pirate Republic, serving as one of its founding captains. A sea elf of mysterious origins, Luna is known for her mystical demeanor and staunch advocacy for magical freedom.

Little is known about Luna's early life. She emerged as a significant figure in pirate circles shortly before the foundation of the Republic, quickly gaining a reputation for her mastery of sea magic and uncanny ability to navigate through dangerous waters.

Unlike many of her more flamboyant pirate counterparts, Luna presents a serene and almost priestess-like appearance. Her sea-green robes and ethereal presence often cause newcomers to mistake her for a religious figure rather than a pirate captain.

Luna leads a crew known as The Night Owls, specializing in stealth operations and magical warfare. Her ship, the Moonshadow, is rumored to be enchanted, capable of blending into fog and darkness.

As a founding member of the Republic's council, Luna represents the interests of magic users and advocates for the free practice and study of arcane arts. She views the Republic as a sanctuary for those persecuted for their magical abilities in other nations, particularly Steorr.

Luna believes that magic is an integral part of the natural world, as vital as the sea itself. She sees the suppression of magic by other nations as not just tyrannical, but as a fundamental misunderstanding of the world's nature. Her speeches often blend political rhetoric with mystical insights.
