The Takers' leader is Nemeis, a female goblin and the sister of Hybris (Split-Tongue). Nemeis is pragmatic, fiercely independent, and deeply opposed to her brother's mysticism and manipulation. She leads through
competence and clarity, wearing a distinctive striped headwrap instead of mask. Her followers respect her for her consistency and protection, not ritual or charisma. She never speaks Hybris's name and serves as a counterforce to his cult. Both siblings grew up together in a jungle trade settlement but took divergent paths after a series of crises: Hybris turned to ritual and myth, while Nemeis turned to survival and action. Nemeis and Hybris are goblins with yellow eyes.
