## The Collapse of the Fountain and Possession of the High Priest (Ancient Old Selvea)

In the twilight of Old Selvea, the elves were gripped by desperation. Their rulers sought to harness more power from their sacred conduit, the Fountain of Blood, through reckless rituals. The attempt backfired spectacularly, triggering a devastating magical backlash. As the Fountain collapsed and the rift to the Feywild sealed shut, chaos engulfed Selvea. Elves aged rapidly, magic turned wild, and despair filled the streets.

Amid this chaos, the High Priest, a figure of immense magical knowledge, entered the Fountain chamber attempting to halt the collapse. But within the closing rift, a being stirred—formless, dreamlike residue from the Feywild. As the priest performed his final ritual, the entity saw an opportunity to escape oblivion. It flowed into him, merging their essences, transforming him into the first host of what would be known as the Drowsy One.

This priest, now a conduit of vast, alien dream magic, wandered from the ruins of Selvea, carrying the entity into history. The rulers, horrified, burned all records—this was the Great Burning. But legends whispered of an immortal wanderer who sang strange lullabies and whose dreams were haunted by whispers from another world.

## The Singer of Stars (Circos – Year ~350 Starlit Era)

Centuries later, the Drowsy One inhabited a famed Sea Elven Moonsinger named Ilia Starcaller from Circos. Her hauntingly beautiful chants guided sailors safely across the Emerald Seas. Slowly, Ilia’s melodies grew strange, her songs filled with visions of impossible lands beneath dreamlit seas. Mariners who heard her songs began vanishing, sailing into eternal sleep beneath the waves.

Eventually, the Sea Elves exiled Ilia to a remote island to halt the tragedies. There she crafted elaborate mosaics depicting the Drowsy One’s visions—a secret record of its existence, hidden until rediscovered centuries later.

## The Warlord's Advisor (Jagged Peaks – Year ~600 Starlit Era)

In the Jagged Peaks, the Drowsy One possessed Kalvan the Seer, advisor to a Goliath warlord. Under its influence, Kalvan guided brutal campaigns fueled by prophetic dreams, driving tribes into bloody conquest. Warriors fought relentlessly, believing Kalvan’s visions promised victory. Eventually, Kalvan’s prophecies became fevered and dark. Betrayed by his own visions, he wandered alone into the mountains, leaving behind only cryptic warnings carved in stone.

## Lady of the Jade Spire (Domiselvea – Year ~850 Starlit Era)

In Domiselvea, the entity inhabited Lady Elaria of the Jade Spire, a powerful noblewoman famed for her wisdom and fairness. Under the Drowsy One’s subtle control, Elaria encouraged elaborate rituals involving the rare Nectar of the Selvean Bluestar flower, deepening dream-states among her followers. Gradually, her court dissolved into dream-addled decadence and madness.

When her excesses became intolerable, Elaria vanished mysteriously, leaving only haunting poetry hinting at an ancient presence behind her dreams.

## The Maskmaker of Kitiri (Kitiri Trench – Year ~970 Starlit Era)

Deep within the coral-walled city-state near the Kitiri Trench, a master artisan named Sanu crafted exquisite ceremonial masks for the local priests. Possessed by the Drowsy One, his masks became infused with dream magic, granting wearers visions of lost worlds and hidden truths. As priests succumbed to madness and paranoia, blaming each other for sacrilege, Sanu disappeared beneath the waves, leaving only his eerie masks scattered throughout the islands, treasured yet feared for their strange influence.

## The Green Witch of Harboursjaw (Harboursjaw – Year ~1130 Starlit Era)

In Harboursjaw, an herbalist called Green Nila became famed for remedies involving strange jungle plants, including the Green Veil fungus. The Drowsy One took her, subtly shaping her healing practice into a cult of dream-visions. Villagers became dependent on Nila’s remedies, their dreams merging and intertwining. When Nila abruptly vanished, the village nearly tore itself apart seeking her wisdom. Her hut remained empty, except for cryptic carvings and jars filled with dreams.

## Old Tetzilwahi Man (Tetzilwahi Ruins – Year ~1170 Starlit Era)

Near the current era, the Drowsy One inhabited an old Tetzilwahi man named Tezcal. Known as the last keeper of ancient secrets, Tezcal’s dreams guided him to the ruined city of his ancestors. For decades, he lived in solitude, speaking only in riddles and strange verses. Stories spread of a hermit who knew the history of the lost tribe. His mind, fragmented by the entity, wove dreams into reality. He awaited the arrival of one destined to seek the truth: Oraya II.

## Oraya II – Current Host (Tetzilwahi Ruins – Present Day, ~1180 Starlit Era)

Oraya II, seeking knowledge about her lost heritage and guided by dreams of Tezcal, journeyed to the Tetzilwahi ruins. Believing Tezcal could reveal the hidden past, she willingly entered the old man's chamber. But upon meeting him, she found only an ancient, fragile husk barely tethered to reality. When Tezcal finally died, the Drowsy One passed into Oraya.

Oraya II became the host of the entity known as Mama Yaya. Under this guise, she created the Hollow Drowse, an overlapping realm of dreams and reality within the ruins. Her influence became profound yet subtle—she guided factions like the Maskbearers through cryptic visions, manipulated scavengers into conflict, and allowed the jungle itself to flourish with dream magic.

Mama Yaya’s presence became legendary. Characters like Granny Moon remembered her as a wise yet enigmatic figure, never realizing the true power behind her calm façade. Now, Oraya II resides within the ruins' sacred mask, her body merged with dream-infused vines and ancient magic, eternally dreaming the dreams of countless lifetimes.

Thus, the Drowsy One endures—shaped by the dreams of every host it ever inhabited, waiting patiently for the next soul brave or foolish enough to seek its hidden truths.
