Marius was a human mage who was the head of smuggling operations on [[Otarky]] for [[The Phantoms]]. He was skilled at illusion magic, which he used to conceal the smuggler's activities from townspeople. After being captured by the [[Adventurers - Star and Dove]], he was killed by [[Viktor]] as revenge for his brother [[Derrick]].
