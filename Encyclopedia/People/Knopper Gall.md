Knopper Gall is an elderly gnome who worked for Esmith's parents as a cleaner. He is known to drink at the Cove Inn in the evening after his shift. He has a fondness for Esmith who always treated him right.

Knopper is a stubby, wrinkled gnome with tufts of wiry white hair sprouting from his ears and head. 

Personality: Gruff and taciturn, Knopper rarely speaks unless necessary and never wastes words. He regards most people with thinly veiled contempt. Knopper is constantly alert and paranoid, always checking over his shoulder. He takes pride in his ability to blend into the background unnoticed. Knopper has a soft spot for Esmith, who treated him kindly, but is suspicious of newcomers. He is extremely secretive about his work for the Wessons. Knopper appears perpetually nervous, as the damaging information he secretly holds could prove deadly.
