Wayne MacGoshan is the captain of [[The B[[Encyclopedia/Groups/Republic/Republic]]e crew and one of the founders of [[Republic]]. His missing teeth and slurred speech do not seem to affect his charisma and powerful songs laden with magic. His crew will follow him anywhere. His right hand and first mate is [[Molly]].
