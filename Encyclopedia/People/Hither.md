Hither is a few years older than Yonder, with a similar petite build but a more mature and world-weary demeanor. Her dark hair is longer than Yonder's, often braided or tied back to keep it out of her face. She wears simple, practical clothing in muted colors, with a few subtle embellishments that hint at her creative side. Her eyes are a deep, thoughtful brown, and she has a small tattoo of a bird in flight on her wrist, a symbol of her yearning for freedom.

**Personality:**
While Yonder is quick-witted and impulsive, Hither is more measured and introspective. She's a deep thinker, always considering the consequences of her actions and the bigger picture. Hither is a natural mediator, able to see multiple sides of an issue and find common ground between conflicting parties.

Hither shares Yonder's strong sense of loyalty to the Guildless community, but she approaches her activism differently. Where Yonder is more likely to take direct action, Hither favors a more subtle approach, using her skills as an artist and storyteller to inspire and educate others.

Hither has a gentle, nurturing nature, and often takes on a motherly role within the Guildless community. She's the one people turn to for advice, comfort, and support. However, beneath her calm exterior, Hither harbors a deep sadness and sense of loss, having witnessed the suffering of her people firsthand.

**Motivations:**
Like Yonder, Hither is motivated by a desire to improve the lives of the Guildless. However, her approach is more focused on long-term change through education and inspiration. Hither believes that the key to the Guildless' liberation lies in changing hearts and minds, not just in physical action.

Hither is also driven by a love of art and storytelling. She sees these as powerful tools for preserving the history and culture of the Guildless, and for sharing their struggles with the wider world. She dreams of one day creating a grand tapestry that tells the story of her people, from their humble beginnings to their ultimate triumph over adversity.

**Interactions with Yonder and the Party:**
Hither and Yonder have a close but sometimes strained relationship. Hither worries about Yonder's impulsiveness and risk-taking, while Yonder can find Hither's caution and introspection frustrating. However, at their core, the two sisters deeply love and respect each other, and will always have each other's backs.

When interacting with the party, Hither will be more reserved than Yonder, taking time to observe and assess them before offering her trust. She'll be interested in their stories and experiences, seeing them as potential allies in her quest to change Sibl√≠n society.

Hither will offer the party a different perspective on the Guildless' struggle, emphasizing the importance of changing minds and hearts as well as taking physical action. She may enlist their help in creating art or stories that showcase the Guildless' humanity and resilience.

In times of conflict or tension, Hither will be a calming presence, using her mediation skills to defuse arguments and find common ground. She'll also be a source of emotional support for Yonder and the party, offering wisdom and comfort in times of stress or sorrow.

Overall, Hither provides a counterpoint to Yonder's more action-oriented approach, balancing her sister's impulsiveness with introspection and long-term thinking. Together, the two sisters represent different facets of the Guildless' struggle, and their interactions with each other and the party will be a source of both tension and growth as they work towards their shared goal of liberation and equality.
