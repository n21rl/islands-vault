Molly is female elf pirate who earned the nickname "Flogging Molly" for her skills with a whip. She has long black hair, angular features and she wears tight black leather armour. She enjoys mocking and dominating her enemies.
She met [[Yazim]] at [[Bard College]], when she was still using the name Angela.
