Mary was born with a connection to plant life, allowing her to manipulate vegetation like reeds and vines through whispers and gestures. This led to her being branded a witch and outcast by superstitious townsfolk. She joined the army, hoping her skills could be an asset. However, she was met with only more mistrust from her fellow soldiers, disturbed by her abilities. 

Her ship was subdued by the roguish pirates [[Calico Jack]] and [[Anne Bony]], who delighted in Mary's mastery over marshlands and reed beds. She deserted to join them and was finally able to embrace her full potential without fear, using her plantbending to empower her new crew who became known as [[The Reed Rangers]]. 

She and Anne developped a relationship. When Anne died, Mary found comfort in Jack's arms. The pair sought out a Mer sorceress together to bring Anne back.
