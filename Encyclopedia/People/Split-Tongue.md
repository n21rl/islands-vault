Split-Tongue is the enigmatic High Priest of the Maskbearers. Outwardly a figure of mystical authority, Split-Tongue conceals a calculating and deeply human core beneath his sacred mask. His name derives from the ceremonial mask he wears: a massive visage of a Tetzilwahi mound god, with a snake's tongue emerging from the mouth. 

### Origins

Once known as Hybris, Split-Tongue was born in a thriving jungle trade camp near the edges of the Tetzilwahi ruins. His family dealt in rare jungle goods and archaeological salvage. As a youth, he was known for his charisma, clever speech, and fascination with old myths—but not devotion. It was not faith that first pulled him toward the ruins, but the allure of significance.

During a time of crisis, Hybris was one of many who turned to old superstitions in search of answers. Yet where others saw only fragments, he saw potential. He began to adopt and reshape the scattered Tetzilwahi beliefs into a coherent vision, positioning himself as the interpreter of the Mounds’ will.

This transformation alienated his sister, who would go on to become the leader of the Takers. Their falling out is more than personal—it reflects the core ideological rift between their two factions: faith versus pragmatism, control through myth versus freedom through autonomy.

### Beliefs and Doctrine

Split-Tongue teaches that the jungle is sacred, and that the Mounds are not relics but dreaming gods, waiting to awaken. Blood, memory, and masks are the instruments of their communion. Through ritual sacrifice and masked identity, followers offer themselves to something older and deeper than civilization.

Yet these teachings are far from fixed. Split-Tongue revises doctrine as needed, embedding flexibility in the guise of revelation. His interpretations are final not because they are immutable, but because they come from him.

He preaches in slow, deliberate cadence—part chant, part trance. His followers believe he speaks in the voice of the Mounds themselves. Outsiders hear only riddles and threats.

### Personality and Methods

Split-Tongue is not a madman. He is a man who chose power when he felt powerless, and who clings to it with polished devotion. Beneath his mask lies a sharp mind and a keen political sense. He recognizes the fragile loyalty of his followers and sustains it through spectacle, sacrifice, and layers of ritual. He is not above deception—especially if it preserves his authority or prevents dangerous truths from surfacing.

He maintains a calm and mystic exterior, but those who threaten his control may discover how swiftly Split-Tongue can shift from prophet to predator.

### Relationship with the Past
Split-Tongue is deeply invested in the constructed mythology of the Maskbearers—but it is unclear whether he truly believes it. Some say he sees the rituals as metaphors. Others believe he once had a genuine vision and has been trying to recreate or control it ever since.

His greatest fear is the arrival of a truth he cannot bend—a truth that might come in the form of ancient memory, surviving witnesses, or cursed blood. He watches outsiders carefully, particularly those tied to the Oraya line or the lost generations of the jungle.
