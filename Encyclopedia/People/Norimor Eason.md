Norimor Ignatius Eason is an eccentric Siblín publisher known for his obsessive attention to printing minutiae. As head of the Eason Press, Norimor produced editions with flawless typography.

A tall, gangly gentleman advanced in years, Norimor has ink-stained fingers, wild tufts of grey hair, and thick spectacles incessantly slipping down his beakish nose. He wears wrinkled coats with misaligned buttons and bulging pockets bursting with printers' tools and page proofs.

Stooped from decades hovering over manuscripts, Norimor squints at text through a large magnifying lens. He habitually taps his foot and mutters under his breath about spacing and leading during conversations. Norimor gesticulates wildly with his ink-dotted hands when irked over a backwards letter or smeared font.

Now quite aged and peculiar, Norimor shuffles around his press examining page layouts, fussing over fonts, and micromanaging each detail. All while grumbling endlessly about his myriad pet peeves regarding the printing process.
