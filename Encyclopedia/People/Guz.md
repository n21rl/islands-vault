The grizzled Guz is the talkative and knowlegeable shopkeeper at [[Shops of the Republic v1#Gunsmith Guz's Guns|Guz's Guns]] in [[New Destiny]], with a missing eye and partial deafness. He enjoys experimenting with gunpowder to create new explosive devices. Rumour has it that's how he lost his eye and damaged his hearing, but he swears it was in battle.
