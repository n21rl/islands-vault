Calico Jack is a charismatic Tabaxi pirate captain and one of the founders of the [[Republic|Republic]]. One of the numerous people named Jack in the Republic, he took on the moniker Calico in reference to his distinct white, ginger and black fur. Bold and daring, he wields twin rapiers in a distinct swordsmanship style. 

Although raised as a girl, he identified as male from a young age. Ostrocisation led him to flee his home and adopt a pirate lifestyle. 

Along with his lovers [[Anne Bony]] and [[Mary Reed]], he is one of the co-captains of [[The Reed Rangers]]. He represents them on the [[Republic's Council]] .

Blamed for the [[Fortune's Favour]] 's sinking, he was captured by the [[Siblín Guilds]] and imprisoned in [[Cavea]]. Hired by the Republic, the [[Adventurers]] freed him in a dramatic prison break.
