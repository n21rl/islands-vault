Backstory and Background

Arrival in the Jaw:
Mo, born Oraya Doltha, washed ashore in the Jaw at the age of 7 during the later part of the war between Selvea and Steorr. She has no memories of her life before this event, except for a single lullaby she sometimes sings—a song unfamiliar to anyone in the city.

Life in the Orphanage:
Mo was taken in by Granny Moon, a Steorrian elven woman running an orphanage in the city. After Selvea took control of the Jaw, the Selvean authorities allowed Granny Moon to continue operating the orphanage to care for children displaced or orphaned by the war.

Adapting to Life in the City:
Growing up in the orphanage, Mo found herself drawn to a group of mischief-makers and miscreants. Despite her initial attempts at thievery, her clumsiness earned her the nickname Fumble. She soon realized her strengths lay elsewhere—her sharp wit and silver tongue made her an adept distraction and peacemaker. Her storytelling skills earned her the affectionate name Mocking Bird, later shortened to Mo.

Personality:
Mo is sharp-tongued, brazen, and stubborn, often antagonistic toward new people. She’s an accomplished liar who values actions over words and tends to pick fights she can’t win, struggling to back down from challenges. Beneath her harsh exterior, she has a caring side that she shows to those she deems deserving.

Appearance:
Mo has a tattoo running down her spine: a crescent moon, a sword, and Bluestar flowers. These elements may symbolize her connection to Granny Moon, her resilience, and her heritage.



## Relationships

[[Granny Moon]]

Role: An older Steorrian elven woman who served as a parental figure to Mo and the other orphans. While firm, Granny Moon was kind and deeply cared for the children, often turning a blind eye to their mischief.

Connection to Mo: Granny Moon’s influence shaped Mo’s values, particularly her ability to navigate difficult situations and care for those she deems family.



2. Ryn (Best Friend)

Role: A human man and Mo’s closest companion during her time in the city. Ryn was always chasing dreams of great heists and mischief, thriving on risk and excitement.

Connection to Mo: Ryn left the city to pursue his ambitions, breaking Mo’s heart. His absence represents both a loss and a lingering inspiration for Mo to carve out her own path.



3. Celfi (Scholar Friend)

Role: A gnome woman and a scholar with a dream of documenting the untold histories of the world.

Connection to Mo: Celfi’s intellectual pursuits contrast with Mo’s practical survival skills, but their friendship highlights Mo’s softer, supportive side. Celfi’s journey into academia offers potential ties to the Jaw’s deeper history and mysteries.

Core Character Hooks

1. The Lullaby:
Mo’s sole memory from before arriving in the Jaw, the lullaby could be a clue to her origins—whether tied to Selvean, Steorrian, or native traditions.


2. The Orphanage:
The orphanage symbolizes Mo’s connection to the war’s aftermath and the cultural tensions in the Jaw. How it operated under Granny Moon’s care and adapted to Selvean oversight could shape Mo’s views on Selvean and Steorrian influences.


3. Conflict and Growth:
Mo’s stubbornness, sharp tongue, and tendency to pick fights offer rich opportunities for personal growth. Will she learn to temper her boldness, or will her tenacity prove essential in navigating the Jaw’s challenges?
