Zak is a Half-Elf Cleric who was marooned on a small island by his crew for being a terrible sailor. There, he was struck by lightning and awoke with magical storm powers. From then on, he vowed to build his power, believing himself to be a god destined for great things. He ran with pirates before being arrested and sentenced by Steorr to work in green salt mines. He was recently released.

He helped the party navigate Sealtham and the Jagged Peaks. When the ship was requisitioned, he ended up staying on Sealtham.
