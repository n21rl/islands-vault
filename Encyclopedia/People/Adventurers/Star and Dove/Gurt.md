Gurt is a 48-year-old Dwarf Artificer and shipwright. His very first captain was the gnome Elisabeth Grey, who turned to piracy and abandoned Gurt on a raid gone wrong years ago. He served a sentence then sailed with many crews. His inventions meld magic and technology. He loves to explore and discover things. 

%%His family name is Ironhammer, which he doesn't divulge to others.%%
## Backstory
Gurt was raised in the mountains settled by dwarves on the Grand Isle. He had always felt drawn the sea and, at 16, he packed up what little belongings he had and made his way to the nearest port.

Captain [[Elisabeth Grey]] is the first captain that took a chance on him. She was a sharp-eyed gnome witih an even sharper tongue. Would treat you fairly if you did your job, and make it well known to all if you weren't. She owned her own ship the Grey Phantom. His crew members became his new family. Gurt served aboard Grey’s ship for almost a decade before times got hard and she turned to piracy. One night on a raid gone wrong, Gurt was left behind on the docks. He was caught by the guards and thrown in the local jail, but received a rather lenient sentence as he managed to convince the magistrate he was merely at the wrong place at the wrong time. For violating the curfew that had been in place at that port city, he received 6 months which he was permitted to serve out by working on an Imperial boat. These days he still hears rumors of a ship that appears like a ghost in the night amongst the islands, but has never crossed paths with Captain Grey since.

He spent most of his adult life moving from ship to ship, in search of the next great adventure. While Gurt was raised in a mining and blacksmithing family, he found some of his skills transferable to woodworking, which made him invaluable as a shipwright. He sold those skills as he learned as much as possible from crew members aboard ships. Gurt is what some people call an Artificer, he learned to weave magical energy through technology, and he can unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. Because magic is distrusted, he often hides his powers and presents them as very advanced technology.

As the years wore on and he served on more and more ships for shorter and shorter periods, the thing that kept Gurt going was his love of adventure the knowledge that there was still something beyond the horizon he had yet to face.
## Current events
The party encountered Grey and her crew while helping out the inhabitants of the island of Otarky in the Scattered Isles, from whom Grey had been stealing and goods. Her ship called the [[Grey Phantom]] discreetly sails in the fog and her crew uses illusions to mask their activities. Gurt recognised Grey but she appeared to not have aged at all in the 30 odd years since he last saw her.
