## Backstory
Born 28 years ago in Áine of the Siblin Guilds, Yazim is the oldest child in his small family of 4. His parents, Erida and Fulric Proudshot, were poor merchants struggling to make ends meet. As a child, Yazim would always try help them sell his parent’s bread at markets. Even as a tot, he was said to have the gift of the glib and could sell anything to anyone. When his parents gave birth to his brother Oryn, Yazim had just turned 10 and was deemed old enough to be trusted with the stand alone. This is when Yazim could really work his magic on unsuspecting tourists and travelling drunkards.

For months, Yazim would head to the market stand every morning in torn, disheveled clothes with just the acceptable amount of dirt makeup lining his face. Yazim would wail and cry and beg to anyone who wasn’t a local, and tell them he was merely a poor orphan, looking to feed his 8 brothers and sisters. They bought it too, every time. Yazim would come home with more money each evening than his parents could even earn in a week, selling week-old, rock-hard bread that was bought solely out of pity. His parents, too busy baking and taking care of Oryn, were unaware of his schemes. He knew they would of course disapprove, as they cared only of making an “honest living”. Bullshit. Yazim watched his family work the same goddamn stand every day and they often still had to go to bed hungry if weather was bad or they couldn’t afford rent. Yazim found that the best way to make money is to play on people’s emotions. No one gives a shit about a poor child, but a miserable, filthy orphan trying to support his siblings? Gold mine.

So, Yazim continued to work his schemes and bring in money for his overworked parents who finally got a chance to rest at home. That is, of course, until he got in to some trouble with some nobleman he scammed a few silver from recognising him with his parents a few weeks later. The man had a stern word with Yazim’s parents, as well as the local authorities, and Yazim’s family was fined 25gp for his trickery. Unable to pay the fine, Yazim’s father begged with the nobleman not to send his oldest to jail. Instead, Yazim was sent to work at the family’s inn for 3 years – cleaning dishes and shovelling horse shit out of the stables. Here, he met the nobleman’s daughter, Esmith. A young rich girl entering her rebellious phase, she took to Yazim quickly and the two of them became great friends. Pulling pranks on guests and making up stories about what life was like outside the Guilds, they were a perfect fit. Esmith’s father grew a further disdain towards Yazim as a result and believed that he was “corrupting” his little girl. By the end of the three years, he was more than happy to send Yazim on his way but first made him a proposition. He offered Yazim and his parents 100gp under the condition that he was to never speak with Esmith again. Yazim’s father said yes without a second thought, and his parents dragged him home. He promised Esmith that they would meet again, and that he loved her.

Yazim’s parents, unsure of what to do with their newfound riches, decided it would be wise to send Yazim to Ben to live with his grandparents while he attends training to become a Bard. His parents figured if it’s his performances that got him into trouble in the first place, they might as well get him to try use his talents for good, and hopefully earn them back some money in the future. He spent his teenage years training as a bard, but didn't end up finding much success. After constantly practicing to try to become more successful, he eventually was able to learn some Bard magic at age 21. For 6 years, Yazim spent his time practicing the arts in the hopes of becoming a successful bard that could make his parents proud of him, and they would never have to worry about money again. Unfortunately, Yazim grew tired of music and sonnets. It was fun enough, but he found that in order to make meaningful money he would have to perform to richer clientele, and Yazim wasn’t a huge fan of such wealthy people. He found them deplorable, throwing needless amounts of money around while people the next town over starved. Yazim found himself travelling all around the Siblin Guilds, finding drunk rich idiots and charging them a fortune once they were too drunk to realise that they were being swindled. If he was to perform anything meaningful or personal, it would be lost on these fools anyways. They’ve spent their whole lives in the lap of luxury, so how could they possibly relate? He may not have had the most comfortable upbringing, but at least Yazim is thankful he hasn’t turned out boring like these sad sacks. 

Whenever Yazim would return home to perform in Áine, he made an effort to sneak out and meet Esmith in secret. They had secretly rekindled their friendship once Yazim graduated and returned home. Both still as raucous as ever, Yazim would tell her stories of scams he pulled while Esmith would tell Yazim of her journeys to and from Helis with her family. After hearing about Yazim’s disdain of performing for the rich, Esmith hatched a plan to smuggle in some Gnomeleaf through her father’s ship and make some easy money for Yazim in the process. Yazim and Esmith start successful smuggling business from Helis to Áine. Yazim would distribute weapons and minor drugs around Siblín Guilds as travelling bard and would use magic to disguise self and charm others to help smuggling business. 
Eventually get help from Helis, Esmith manages to get own ship from father and go on “holiday tours” around the Siblins and Helis under her family’s brand

Deciding to give up on performing altogether for financial reasons, Yazim spent his early to late twenties as a successful smuggler, bringing in Hagroot and other contraband from Helis. Hagroot is a plant from Helis that can become either a precious spice or a drug, depending on processing. It is an underground drug used in Helis in important rituals and high-class parties, it gives the user a feeling of euphoria and heightened awareness. If someone overuses it or ends up in withdrawal from it, they experience terrifying, realistic nightmares and have difficulty sleeping for the next day or two.
I Yazim disguised himself as reputable merchants and charmed others with relative ease. He was able to pull this off especially well due to the help of his long-time friend Esmith, a human woman belonging to a powerful local noble family that she wanted no part of. Esmith had no need for any of the profits due to her family's wealth, so Yazim was extra happy to have her alongside with him as he could keep nearly all of the profit, sharing most of it with his struggling family who thought Yazim was employed as a simple travelling merchant.
Yazim would travel also to “perform” in Helis and get new clients and make contacts
Hire small crew of 7 travelling between islands at a time. Moderate success for 3 years
Learn about new drug Hagroot that’s cheap to process and used in Helian religious practices
Manage to find a contact that’s secretly growing extra, willing to process it and sell it to us in bulk
Yazim and Esmith manage to set up supply chains across Siblin Guilds and Helis, and over 5 years build a massive empire off Hagroot entirely
Yazim gets most of the profit, Esmith has no need for money and just happy to smuggle and sail with Yazim

Finally, after 8 years of smuggling, Yazim able to eventually pay off parents and let them retire early to take care of Oryn under the guise of Yazim being a successful traveling Bard.

o   Yazim’s brother Oryn was crippled by neighbours livestock at age 4, unable to find steady employment and spends most time at home reading and writing.

§  He would love hearing tales of Yazim’s journey, and Yazim would feel incredibly guilty for having to lie about who he is to his younger brother.

-          Shortly after, a disguised Yazim gets caught by Selvean guards investigating Helis over claims of ships exporting Hagroot.

-          Before Yazim could be tried and sentenced, Esmith came forward and said that the whole operation was hers and hers alone, taking the fall for Yazim.

-          A daughter of now famous nobility, Esmith received a much lighter sentencing compared to what would have been Yazim’s execution.

o   Wesson family – major supplier of transport and lodging among Siblin Guilds. Main consumers are business savvy sailors and rich tourists.

o   Their business empire exploded over the last 20 years, and there’s massive rumours of them having their hands in the pockets of local guards and politicians

After years of successful smuggling, one of Yazim's plans ends up going awry. He failed to mention the side effects of Hagroot and was ratted out to authorities from an angry customer after they experience horrifying nightmares. Esmith ended up choosing to take the blame for Yazim, as she figures her family name would lessen any punishment she would end up receiving. However, due to her family growing tired of Esmith's rebellion and wanting to avoid a scandal, her parents decide to make an example of her and send her to jail, disowning her in the process.

Dropping his disguise, Yazim sneaks home to Áine.  A week of uneasy hiding later, Yazim returns home after entertaining local drunks to find his house broken into with all the furniture upturned and everything searched. Fearing for his family’s safety, he leaves for Star Point the same night under the guise of Brennlin Oxspring, a Steorrian bard willing to do whatever odd job he can to get by. After learning of Esmith's sentencing in Áine while visiting relatives in Cad, Yazim returns home a week later to find his house broken into and everything upturned after being heavily searched. Fearing for his and his family's safety, Yazim decided to flee to Star Point.

Yazim figures he may be a bit safer from Selvea in Steorrian territory . A year after fleeing Áine , he ends up joining the crew of Captain Orguk with the goal of delivering cargo for Hugh Bowes. Taking the identity of Brennlin Oxspring, a jovial bard looking for a bit of extra coin, Yazim joins the party at the harbour in hopes of being able to raise enough money to pay for Esmith's massive bail amount, and hopefully see her as well as his own family when everything settles down. At home, magic was tolerated but always used for a specific purpose. When Yazim eventually learned magic, he figured he might as well have fun with it and use it to get some easy money by tricking merchants and guards. Yazim thinks that if you're one of the lucky few who can cast magic, you might as well use it for your own enjoyment or personal gain. He cannot understand why people would hesitate to use magic, even in its most destructive form. Yazim is not very happy about having to hide his magic among Steorrians: As someone who grew up struggling financially and later failed to become a successful bard, he feels that magic is a core part of his identity that makes him special when compared to others. He outwardly projects himself as confident and boastful in an effort to hide this inferiority complex he developed. Without magic, Yazim is no better than a jester with a lute.

## Relationships

### Immediate family (in Áine)
Fulric (Human man) and Erida (Selvean Elven woman): Yazim's parents.  Poor merchants living in Áine. Not wanting them to have to keep struggling financially was a big decision in Yazim's turn to crime, however as far as he knows they never were aware of his smuggling.
Oryn (Half-Elf, 18-year old): Brother. Ever since he was in a serious accident when he was 4, he's had difficulty moving and is unable to find steady employment. Always believed in Yazim, even when he was struggling as a bard.

### Extended family (in Ben)
Clíodhna (Erida’s mother, Elf): Grandmother
Shawn (Erida’s brother, Elf): Uncle
Damo (Shawn’s son, Elf): Cousin
Middle class, they tended to look down at Yazim and his family with pity. Only when they heard about Yazim's success as a "merchant" did they take any interest in him and his family. Yazim harbours a disdain for them as a result, but his parents are of the mindset that family comes first.

### Friends
[[Esmith Wesson]]: Best friend/Smuggle Partner (Human, whereabouts unknown, presumably jailed). childhood friend of Yazim. Daughter of important noble Wesson family, well known business specialising in transport and lodging, with ties in local government and guards paid off to do as they say. Yazim misses her dearly and is wracked with guilt over her jailing. Wonders if she will ever forgive him for leaving.

Lou: friend from Bard College, Lou caught wind of Yazim’s operation and wanted in, so became his distributor in Áine.

### Goals
**Goal:** Currently, Yazim’s main goal is to earn himself a lot of gold. If asked, he will lie and say that his family is still poor and that the money is for his family back home, when in reality the gold is for himself. He plans on using the gold later on to look into what happened with Esmith, and figures he’s going to need a lot of it to get serious work done.

**Currently:** Yazim is happy to go along with whatever the party suggests as long as it stays clear of the Siblíns and Helis for a while. Once he gathers enough gold and enough time has passed, he plans to return home and try free Esmith. Should he still be hiding his identity or the party have different plans, he may leave to pursue his own goals alone. (Yazim won’t cheat a friend – he wouldn’t steal from or harm a party member unless he despised them)

**Future Goals:** Find out what happened to Esmith. Try break her out of jail/ pay her bounty if possible. Look into any possible misdoings of the Wesson’s in an effort to get them out of local authorities pockets – Yazim thinks that they decided to make an example out of Esmith in fear of losing trade with clients from Helis and Selvea.
