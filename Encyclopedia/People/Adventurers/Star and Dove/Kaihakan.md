## Backstory
Kaihakan is a 23-year-old Human Fighter/Warlock who was found as a baby and raised by the [[Hakari Sea Elves]]. The Hakari were cast away to inhospitable islands in the Scattered Isles for their worship of Tanawhu, a squid god that is said to fight the whale goddess Savisi'lo for dominion over the souls of dead sea elves. Tohunga Kahwra, a priestess of Tanawhu, was Kaihakan foster mother. He has spent most of his life hunting whales and trading with merchants brave enough to sail the choppy Hakari waters.

Kaihakan's had left the settlement one day to hunt for fish and upon his return in his canoe saw the suspended platforms built around the crags collapsing into the sea. He believes he witnessed Tanawhu's own tentacles attempting to hold the structures aloft but in vain as they slid beneath the waves. Then, Kai saw a massive whale breach the surface of the water and dive back below as Tanawhu's tentacles receded in fear.

The Hakari Isles were utterly destroyed and to Kaihakan’s knowledge, he is the sole survivor of this attack. For this reason, Kaihakan has an intense fear and hatred for sea monsters, or Taniwha.  Kai believes that Savisi'lo destroyed his home and slaughtered the Hakari out of spite for Tanawhu. He is fuelled by zealous rage to become Tanawhu's champion and to descend into Pupaia, to slay Savisi'lo and to avenge or retrieve his dead tribe from the underworld in the name of the Great Squid.
