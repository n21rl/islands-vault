The Steorrian Paladin: Character Recap

Background and Origin:

The Paladin is a proud Steorrian, deeply tied to the traditions of his homeland. He is a Paladin of Conquest, reflecting his disciplined, martial upbringing and the Steorrian belief in order and control.

His devotion is rooted in the values of Steorr, which include a strict monotheistic faith and a disdain for magic.

Despite Steorr’s general rejection of magic, the Paladin either eschews magic entirely, flavoring his abilities as mundane but extraordinary feats of martial skill, or embraces his powers as a rare and controversial practitioner in Steorr.


Appearance and Personality:

The Paladin proudly wears the colors of Steorr, displaying his loyalty and identity.

He is meticulous and disciplined, a figure of strength and resolve who represents Steorrian ideals.

Despite his pride, the Paladin is pragmatic and aware of the complex political tensions in the Jaw, making him capable of nuanced decisions and alliances.


Thematic and Cultural Notes:

Steorrian Influence: His homeland of Steorr is a kingdom defined by its rejection of magic, adherence to a single god, and rigid social hierarchy. The Paladin’s upbringing was likely steeped in these ideals, though he may begin to question them as the campaign unfolds.

Conflict in the Jaw: Steorr’s oppressive actions in the Jaw—ranging from religious imposition to pseudo-scientific experiments on consciousness—cast a shadow over his role as a conqueror. The Paladin may grapple with his place in this legacy, balancing his personal values with the actions of his nation.

A New Perspective: Exposure to the diverse and magical cultures of the Jaw, as well as the fallout of Steorr’s defeat in the war, could challenge the Paladin’s worldview.


Character Details and Flavor:

Faith and Magic: If his abilities are flavored as non-magical, they might represent an exceptional mastery of martial techniques. Alternatively, if he is a rare Steorrian magic user, it underscores his uniqueness and possible tension with his homeland’s values.

Cultural Symbolism: His drinking of infused leaves (tea) ties him to Steorrian tradition and serves as a personal and cultural motif.

Balance of Pride and Adaptability: While the Paladin is rooted in his nation’s ideals, his ability to adapt to the Jaw’s complexities and the campaign’s challenges makes him a compelling figure.


Mechanical Notes:

The Paladin is built around the Oath of Conquest, emphasizing themes of fear, domination, and control. This aligns with Steorr’s militaristic ethos but also opens opportunities for the character to explore the moral cost of such power.

His Steorrian identity and the flavoring of his abilities—whether magical or not—are key elements that can shape his role in the story.
