Bugbear barbarian, part of the native people of the Jaw. 
His parents called him "big and strong" and the name stuck as Biggs Tong. 

Revengetarian - Mainly vegetarian diet; only eats meat from animals that try to eat Biggs or his allies.

Biggs Tong

Biggs’ is a male bugbear, 62 years old. His ancestors being native to Selvea, decided to stay in their homeland with the Elves instead of leaving or fighting, and allied with them. 

His family upheld strong Elven principles, and Biggs was taught at a young age that manners maketh the man.

As a young adult, Biggs found himself hopping between white collar jobs as he found the work tedious and kind-numbing. His parents refused to let him work any kind of job that required manual labour, as they believed he would be feeding into potential Bugbear stereotypes and “undoing decades of progress”.

After his basic military training, Biggs dreamed of becoming a champion but his parents refused. They instead used their connections to get Biggs a job as a guard, however much to Biggs’ dismay, he was purposefully enlisted as a lookout guard so that he could stay out of harms way.

Despite his need for thrill seeking, Biggs is still a polite man and is well-groomed and well-dressed. After 40 years as a lookout guard, he retired two years ago when turned 60.

Biggs spent his first year and a half of retirement doing community work and took up an interest in gardening, enjoying his quiet life at home with his husband Richard.

Richard was a well-mannered Elf, who took a liking to Biggs’ civilised mannerisms. His family is well known and well-respected around Selvea. The marriage was arranged by his parents the day Biggs turned 25 as they didn’t want him to stay single, and wanted to establish a relationship between their family and Richard’s. Despite Biggs’ initial protest of the marriage, he grew to love Richard and they adopted an Elven daughter 5 years later, who they named Adeline. (now aged 33)
Adeline has a family of her own now, married to another Elf named Simon, with two children of their own who Biggs has yet to meet.

## Reason for adventuring
Last year, Biggs’ husband Richard grew ill. Despite years of perfect health, he suddenly grew weak and was made bed-bound by a mysterious illness. Biggs’ never left Richard’s side, and he passed about four months ago.

After growing tired of living a solitary suburban life, Biggs decided to adventure out in the world and experience all it has to offer, finally getting to live his life the way he wanted as a young man. 

Having never visited Harboursjaw, Biggs decides to start there and see what kind of excitement awaits him in the capital.

## Bonds + Ideals:

A kind, principled man, Biggs would not resort to violence unless needed or attacked first. After all, he has an image to uphold.

Biggs’ relationship with Adeline is a bit strained, she doesn’t understand why Biggs needs to go adventuring and should be relaxing after retirement and recent loss of his husband. Biggs’ believes that Adeline may be embarrassed to have a Bugbear as a parent, so despite his love for her they have slightly grown apart over time. Whether this belief of his is justified or just an insecurity is anyone’s guess.
