### **Backstory**

- **Childhood and the Church**:
    
    - Yasmine was taken by the Church of the Unwavering Star as a child, either as punishment for her family or to fulfil a taxation-like obligation.
    - She was raised strictly in the temple, either as a Scribe or Acolyte, with her mentor being her only parental figure.
    - Her mentor was devout but harsh, instilling the belief that magic was a "taint" and training her to suppress her magical abilities, often through rough methods.
    - Despite the strict upbringing, Yasmine fully believed in the Church’s doctrines and felt ashamed of her magical powers.
- **The Turning Point**:
    
    - A fellow mentee, her best friend also a gnome, fell ill with something that could have been solved with a simple spell.
    - Yasmine begged her mentor to let her use her magic, but the mentor refused, claiming it was better for the friend to die than to be "tainted."
    - Her friend's death led Yasmine to question her faith and the Church’s teachings.
    - She stole a relic (possibly bones or a similar object) that she believes can help her revive her friend and fled the Church.

### **Life in the Jaw**

- Yasmine ended up in Harboursjaw, knowing little of life outside the Church.
- She was taken in by The Hammer, a Steorrian criminal syndicate that provides support to Steorrians in the region.
- She works in the poor district, offering healing and aid to people who can’t access official channels.

### **Appearance and Magic**

- Yasmine’s use of magic causes her appearance to shift in ways inspired by Indonesian mythology, such as aspects of Barong.
- These changes reinforce her doubts and fears about being "tainted."
- Her Light Domain connection ties to her pursuit of truth and the internal conflict with the faith she was raised in.
