Background and Origin:

Lantern Head is a high elf wizard from Selvea, originally captured during the early years of the Steorrian-Selvean war. His capture parallels the historical precedent of early colonial captives, taken as trophies or test subjects.

While Steorr generally abhors magic, Lantern Head fell into the hands of a rogue Steorrian "scientist," who secretly conducted experiments on consciousness. The experiments led to the removal of Lantern Head's brain, which was liquefied and sealed within a magical lantern that now functions as his head.


Physical Traits:

Lantern Head: His lantern head is enchanted to heal itself like flesh and is integral to his survival. Mechanically, it allows him to function normally, with his hit points covering damage to his "body" and the lantern.

Movements: He is lithe, flexible, and unnervingly fluid, moving like a chicken with a stationary head. His limbs’ unnatural grace often unsettles onlookers.

Communication: Lantern Head cannot speak and communicates through writing, hand gestures, illusion cantrips, and eerie ghostly wails emitted from his lantern.


Aesthetic and Spellcasting Features:

Spellbook: The lantern also functions as his spellbook, with spells inscribed on the glass. If the glass becomes damaged, he must repair and reinscribe the spells, representing a challenge tied to his unique physiology.

Verbal Components: The lantern flickers and projects light when casting spells. This serves as a workaround for verbal components but can hinder stealth or be impeded by magical darkness or physical coverings.


Themes and Personality:

Alienation: Having escaped Steorr and returned to Selvea, Lantern Head finds himself unrecognizable and unable to connect with his people or culture, both of which have been irrevocably changed by the war.

Study of Magic: While under the scientist's control, he secretly studied magic at night, inscribing spells into the lantern. His escape was accomplished through cunning and illusions, reflecting his resourcefulness.

Unsettling Presence: His appearance and mannerisms—his glowing, shifting lantern, strange gait, and ghostly wails—contribute to an otherworldly and alien air, aligning with his Reborn lineage.


Lineage and Cultural Background:

Lantern Head originally hails from a Selvean elven lineage, though his exact tribe or cultural background remains flexible.


Mechanical Notes:

Lantern Head will use the Reborn lineage from Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, which reflects his transformation into something beyond mortal.

His spellbook is tied to the lantern’s condition, creating a potential gameplay dynamic if it is scratched or damaged.


Current Status:

Lantern Head has recently returned to Selvea after escaping his captor in Steorr. He is a stranger in his homeland, haunted by his past and struggling to reconcile his identity with what remains of his culture.
