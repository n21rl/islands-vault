Aumiha is a sea elf woman who grabbed Kaihakan into an alley to escape from a chaotic situation after he was wrongly accused of poisoning whale meat. She led him through the sewers to a flooded cave that served as her hideout. Aumiha confronted Kaihakan about his association with whalers, as she saw whales as envoys of [[Savisi'lo]], a deity revered by sea elves for preserving the peace of the sea and the underworld. She revealed that she had poisoned the whale meat with a substance she found in a cave, as part of her mission to investigate the migration of whales away from the south of the archipelago and the impact of whaling by Sibl√≠n sailors. 

Aumiha and Kaihakan, despite their initial differences, found common ground in their disdain for the use of ambergris from whales in perfumes, which both considered sacrilegious. She asked for Kaihakan's help to taint the ambergris supply to send a message from the sea elves, which he agreed to do. After successfully completing the task, Aumiha provided Kaihakan with a map to her hideout and announced her intention to return to her tribe.
