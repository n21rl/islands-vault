Vesper Martini is an androgynous elven pirate spy and diplomat. They are the first mate of [[The Drunks]], working for [[Captain Morgan]] (who they call M). They use elegant disguises, deception, and connections to obtain information. One of their recent mission involved infiltrating an anti-pirate expedition ordered by [[Lord Mayor Brummbär]], under the identity of Mr Fleming.
