Paxitli is the [[Selvea|Selvean]] Envoy of the [[Jaw]], tasked with overseeing governance and maintaining stability in the province. As a [[Gender in Selvean Culture#Children of the Gloam|Child of the Gloam]], they embody Selvean ideals of duality and transition, holding a unique cultural and political role. They are a respected, though sometimes controversial, figure in Harboursjaw, balancing the interests of allowed factions.

## Appearance
Paxitli has warm ochre skin and deep green hair long on one side while the other is shaved close in an undercut. Often run their fingers along their shaved scalp when deep in thought. Their eyes are a rich, steady brown. Their features are angular but refined, and their posture is upright.

They wear robes in in muted colours, sometimes adored in silver embroidery depicting celestial and elemental patterns that runs along the sleeves and hems.

They speak in a calm, measured tone, pausing before answering difficult questions. 

## Personality and Leadership Style
Idealistic and diplomatic but perhaps naïve about the depth of tensions in the region.

Paxitli is known for their measured, deliberate manner. They rarely raise their voice but command attention through carefully chosen words and strategic pauses. Their leadership style prioritizes subtle influence over direct confrontation, preferring to guide discussions and shift perspectives rather than dictate outcomes.

They see governance as an act of balance, requiring both decisive action and patience. They do not view compromise as weakness but as a method of shaping new possibilities between extremes. However, they are not without limits—when pushed beyond reason, they will assert authority with unwavering resolve.

They are often seen as a calm and stabilizing presence in council meetings and negotiations, though detractors accuse them of being too careful, too unwilling to commit fully to one side.

As Envoy of the Jaw, Paxitli represents the Selvean Empire in Harboursjaw, overseeing governance and ensuring that Selvean interests are maintained while keeping peace with local factions. Their position is delicate—they must enforce imperial rule while preventing open rebellion.

Paxitli is regarded as a skilled diplomat and political figure, though their legacy remains uncertain. Whether they will be remembered as the leader who held the Jaw together or the one who delayed inevitable conflict is still unfolding.

Their position remains precarious, and the shifting tides of politics may yet force them to choose between the stability they strive for and the reality of a world that may not allow it.

Paxitli adheres to a philosophy rooted in Selvean duality, believing that all forces—earth and sky, blood and spirit, tradition and change—must be brought into balance rather than allowed to dominate one another.

They see peace not as passivity, but as an active process requiring vigilance, adaptability, and strategic intervention. They believe in working within the system to transform it from within, rather than tearing it down outright.

Their views sometimes clash with more radical factions, who see them as too cautious or unwilling to fully commit to change.

### Relations with Other Factions

- Selvean Empire: As an imperial representative, Paxitli enforces Selvean law and cultural policies, though they advocate for measured integration rather than forced assimilation.
- Jawists: Paxitli recognizes the growing push for local governance and autonomy. While they oppose full independence, they often negotiate compromises to appease Jawist leaders.
- Steorrians: They maintain a cautious but pragmatic relationship with Steorrian factions, recognizing their economic and military influence in the region. They prefer diplomatic containment over outright hostility.
- Elven Purists: They strongly oppose Purist efforts to exclude non-Selveans from governance, believing that true balance requires integration rather than isolation.
- Shadow Legion: They are not aware of the Legion’s covert influence but their ideals are in deep opposition to their aggressive efforts.
