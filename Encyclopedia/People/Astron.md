> “He bore no sword until the Star gave him one. He bore no crown until the world placed it upon him. He bore no heir, for the realm itself is his legacy.”
– First Concordance, Prologue



## Birth Under the Star

Astron was born in the final years of the Darkness, on the night the Unwavering Star first appeared in the heavens. His birth is marked in the calendar as Year 0 of the Starlit Age.

He was of noble descent, though his parents' names are not recorded—likely members of the ancient Clan Steorr, divided by blood-feud. Some say he was conceived between warring houses, a symbol of unity yet to come.

He was raised in seclusion, guided by elders, warriors, and scribes. Folk tales speak of a strange wanderer named Myrddin, said to have taught the boy to read the stars. The Church disavows such figures, insisting that Astron’s wisdom came from divine contemplation, not sorcery or heresy.



The Shard and the Sword

When he reached his thirtieth year, a comet streaked across the sky—a sign to all who watched for omens. Astron journeyed east and found a shard of the Star embedded in the land, still warm with cosmic light.

He carried it to Saint Weland, the sanctified smith. In his forge, Hardblade was born—a blade of unbreakable metal, said to be impossible for false hands to lift. Some say the sword sang when wielded. Others claim it burned only when borne in justice.

With Hardblade, Astron marched to the Battle of the Hollow Pass, where he and a smaller force turned back a horde of warlords. It was the first true miracle of the Star’s new age.




## The Concord and the Founding of the Kingdom of Steorr

Following his victory, Astron summoned the divided clans to Stonefire Mesa, a place of ancient echoes and molten stone. There, twelve leaders met beneath the Star’s light. The First Concord was forged—not only a treaty, but a covenant of law, purpose, and flame.

Astron did not crown himself. The Concord named him First Among the Flame, and the realm of Steorr was born.

Some stories tell of a thirteenth seat, left empty or abandoned. Others whisper of a Concordant who refused the oath—out of love, or fear, or knowledge of what was to come.




The Age of Flame

Astron ruled not as tyrant or prophet, but as servant of the Flame. He created the Star Courts, wrote the Laws of the Concord, and sent knights and emissaries into the far reaches of the land.

His knights journeyed on quests of unification and cleansing, ensuring no region remained untouched by the Star’s light. Their stories are collected in the Book of Circuits, though many names have been lost.

## The Final Battle and the Last Voyage

In his final years, the Concord faced fracture. Rebellion stirred at the edges of the realm. Astron took up Hardblade once more and rode into battle.

After the battle, he sailed eastward, accompanied by a small retinue. His destination: the island where he had first found the shard of the Star. He arrived, but never returned.

Some say a rift opened, and he passed into it. Others say he sailed on, following the Star’s reflection, seeking the place it had come from.

His sword was never seen again. His body was never found. The Church calls this event the Ascension of the Unifier, and no successor was named.

Saint Brenna, inspired by his journey, sailed east generations later. She, too, never returned.
