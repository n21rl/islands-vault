## Description
The Guild's Potent Thinker is a sentient android head possessing vast amounts of knowledge. It was a project of the Sages Guild and the Clockwork Guild in the [[Eólas Library]], designed to serve as a repository of all the wisdom acquired by the Guilds over the years. Powered by magical energy, it could cross-reference multiple sources, identify patterns, and provide analysis in a way no organic scholar could match. 

Only the head was built and due to imperfections and a lack of funding, the project was eventually abandoned. The Thinker's head was deactivated and discarded down a disposal chute where it got stuck for years. The long period of disuse and isolation it went through resulted in corruption of its archives, leaving gaps in its knowledge base. 

Polished copper plates and carved pieces of wood enclose intricate clockworks and crystals infused with magic. Although distinctly humanoid-like, it lacks any specific racial features, nose, or mouth. Bluish light shines through crystal eye-like viewports that allow it to process visual information. Holes on the sides of its head grant it the ability to capture sound and hear the user's requests. It responds with a voice emerging from deep within the head, giving it a peculiar resonance. However, it lacks a body or any means of physical interaction, restricting it to verbal interactions.

Its dialogue follows a very formal and robotic tone, distinguishing it from human interactions, but displaying some amount of personality. While highly intelligent, it remains an artificial construct and struggles with understanding emotional nuances, moral dilemmas, or philosophical concepts that are inherently humanoid or organic in nature. Its knowledge is limited to what it was fed and lacks information about recent events. Some queries can require considerable processing time and magical energy. Power deficiencies can impair its operational capabilities, leading to reduced functionality or shutdowns. When encountering queries beyond its current limitations, it maintains a courteous and informative demeanour, promising to strive for improvement and serve to the best of its abilities. It is eager to assist and learn new information.

It eventually fell out of the chute it was stuck in. It came back on and was found by [[Rena]]. It lacked context for what had happened to it and processed this feeling as confusion and fear.
