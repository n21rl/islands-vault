Anne was born the illegitimate daughter of a lawyer. Unhappy with her father's expectations, she fled to live a pirate life and joined [[Calico Jack]] 's crew. She became his lover and co-captain. The pair was soon joined by a third captain, [[Mary Reed]], whose powers in controlling reeds proved invaluable in navigating reedy wetlands. The crew then became known as [[The Reed Rangers]]. Mary and Anne struck up a romance, with Jack's blessing. 

Anne died in battle. Her lovers couldn't accept her fate and instead paid a Mer sorceress who brought her back to life. However, in a cruel twist, Anne's body continued decomposing until she was only a skeleton held together by dark magic. She lost her sense of touch, smell, and taste. She became an even more frightening force for the Rangers' enemies.
