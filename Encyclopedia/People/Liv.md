Liv is a caring vet based in Otarkys, on the island of [[Otarky]]. She has a gift that allows her to speak with animals. 
She nursed [[Kawrl]] back to health after they were hurt when the [[Adventurers]] first arrived in Otarky. 
She was called to help the inhabitants of Otarkyn deal with their strange bird curse. 
She convinced the adventurers to bring [[Pery]] to his natural habitat in the [[Jagged Peaks]] and accompanied them on the journey. She left to go back home after the party arrived on [[New Destiny]].
