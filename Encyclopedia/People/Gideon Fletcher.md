Gideon Fletcher is a seasoned mercenary and explorer from Steorr. He is a rugged and tall figure, with piercing grey eyes and a constant stubble.

One of his recent missions was to secretly collect magic items from around the Northern Scattered Isles. Rena was part of his crew then.

Due to his experience, he was hired by Lord Mayor Brummbär of Sealtham to head a pirate-hunting expedition aboard the Wavecutter, accompanied by the White Clam and the Asteroidea. Expanding the scope of the mission, he has established a base on an island not too far from New Destiny. This has reinvigorated colonization efforts in the region. He has secret plans ([[Fletcher's Plans]]).
