Mama Yaya resides within the Tetzilwahi ruins, in a forgotten part of the jungle reclaimed by nature and spirit. Her domain, known as the Hollow, overlays a hidden section of these ruins, blending ancestral decay, overgrown plant-magic, and dreamlike enchantment. Mama Yaya deals in dreams and uses a sacred frog known as the Dream Eater. Her magic affects time by allowing characters to explore alternate paths through dreams. She may offer deals-
such as curing Biggs of Wardog's Curse- but the price is uncertain.


She is a maternal, fey-touched figure with ambiguous motives-
sometimes helpful, sometimes frightening, never entirely trustworthy. Mama Yaya deals in dreams, using a sacred frog known as the Dream Eater. Her magic allows characters to explore alternate paths through dreams, which is how she affects time. She might offer deals, including to cure Biggs of Wardog's Curse, but the price she demands is uncertain.

Mama Yaya is a green hag located in the jungle ruins of the Tetzilwahi Mounds. She is tied to nature and jungle magic and operates solely for her own benefit-while she sees everything as connected to her own story or design, her goals are ultimately self-serving and may conflict with the interests of the player characters. She may help weaken Tzecto through ancient magic, not time manipulation directly. Time travel is a side effect or tool she uses to test, torment, or reveal truths to the party. She offers powerful but dangerous deals that may function as promised, but are often laced with trickery or unintended consequences.

Mama Yaya

Mama Yaya is a powerful, fey-touched hag who resides within the decaying remnants of the Drowsy One Mask in a twisted jungle realm known as the Hollow. She is a matron of rot, dream, and bargain—equal parts healer, predator, and oracle. Infamous across the Jaw for her disturbing intimacy and the eerie accuracy of her insight, Mama Yaya embodies the dangers of desperation and desire in a world shaped by ancestral grief and magical scars.

Appearance

Though her form shifts like mist across moonlight, Mama Yaya is often seen as an unnervingly youthful woman with hair like tangled silver vines and eyes the color of old milk. Her smile is beautiful until it isn’t. Her skin may crack open to reveal bark or fungus. Her familiar, a sacred frog known as the Dream Eater, sometimes emerges from her chest cavity, croaking truths in riddles.

Her presence is accompanied by:

A warbling tension in the air, as if time hiccups near her

The scent of overripe fruit, mud, and bruised flowers

Unnatural stillness in the jungle, as even birds seem to hold their breath


The Hollow

Yaya's domain overlays a forgotten section of the Tetzilwahi ruins, where nature and nightmare have reclaimed what was once sacred. Known as the Hollow, this place is not fully real. It hums with dream-logic and memory, shaped as much by emotion as by geography. The deeper one walks, the less they remember why they came.

The Hollow features:

Sunken shrines half-swallowed by moss

Bioluminescent vines that whisper when touched

Pools that reflect not the viewer’s image, but a memory they've lost

Illusions so potent they bleed


Magic and Influence

Mama Yaya is not a simple spellcaster. Her magic seeps through the cracks of reality, working through bargains, bodily transformation, and altered perception. Her power is rooted in the ancient rites of the [[Tetzilwahi elves]], particularly their use of illusion, blood, and sacred masking.

The Dream Eater

The Dream Eater is both a creature and a ritual tool. Those who allow it to consume a dream or memory can traverse potential timelines, viewing alternate versions of their choices. This is not harmless—travelers may return changed, and the line between dream and truth begins to blur.

Yaya uses these dreams to:

Test loyalty

Reveal hidden truths

Offer forbidden glimpses of the future

Manipulate the outcome of major events


Deals and Costs

Mama Yaya helps—but never freely. Her prices are rarely stated outright. Instead, they unfold over time, often in symbolic or bodily ways. She may:

Cure [[Biggs]] of the [[Wardog’s Curse]], but implant a seed in his chest that later demands nourishment

Offer insight into Tzecto’s downfall, but require the name of someone the character has sworn to protect

Remove a character’s fear, and with it, their ability to sense danger


Her most common prices include:

Memories of joy or love

Physical mutations that come to feel natural

Lifelong dependencies on her magic

Giving her a piece of your future


Personality and Voice

Yaya speaks slowly, intimately, and always with certainty. She calls strangers “my little roots” or “my drowse-born.” Her moods shift like weather: calm and maternal one moment, terrifyingly cold the next. She views her interventions as gifts—even when they maim.

Her presence evokes fear not because she threatens violence, but because she sees too much, and her touch lingers.

Lore and Role in the Campaign

Mama Yaya is believed to be older than colonial memory. Some say she was once a Tetzilwahi matriarch who consumed too much dream-magic and became something else. Others whisper she was born of the jungle itself, a counter-force to Selvean domination.

Possible ties include:

A past connection with [[Granny Moon]], who may have sought her aid long ago

Knowledge of the [[Fountain of Blood]] and its legacy

An ancient rivalry with the [[Shadow Legion]] or their master, [[Tzecto]]

Ties to the Jaw’s dream-spirits and forgotten gods


Using Mama Yaya in the Story

Yaya can appear as:

A narrative fork: offering players choices that reshape timelines

A source of terrible knowledge: knowing the price is steep

A mirror to a character’s arc: exposing what they fear to become

A wild card ally against major enemies—but always for her own ends


Whether she is an antagonist, mentor, or recurring threat, Mama Yaya is best used when players are desperate, vulnerable, or seeking something they shouldn’t.

## Mama Yaya

Mama Yaya is an otherworldly being—neither Fey nor mortal—born from the magical rupture once known as the [[Fountain of Blood]]. She is not a god, but a fragment of something too strange and old for gods. When the Fountain collapsed, sealing the rift between worlds, Yaya was left behind, still half-formed. Since then, she has made a home in the deepest jungle, weaving her will into memory, dream, and story.

She is not a villain. But she is dangerous.

### Origins and Nature

Yaya did not begin as a person. She was **not born**, but **left over**—a dreamlike residue from the Feywild or something beyond it, ejected into the world through the Fountain of Blood. She was never meant to remain in the Material Plane, and yet she endured.

Lacking identity, she gathered it from the minds of others—grief, fear, desire, memory. Over time, Yaya became a person-shaped answer to the Jaw’s most lingering questions. She is composed of unfinished stories, half-shed regrets, and ancestral dreams that refused to die.

Yaya anchored herself in the jungle by creating the **Hollow**, a warped dream-space overgrown into reality. It is part sanctuary, part trap—a shifting realm of illusions and echoes, where time and memory blend. Those who enter it risk losing track of who they are.

### Appearance and Presence

Yaya presents herself as maternal, calm, and eerily poised. Her face shifts subtly between moments of beauty and decay. Her silver hair is knotted with vines. Her voice is low and steady, full of patience and weight.

She never rushes, never pleads, and never blusters. Instead, she waits. She watches. She offers.

Her familiar—the **Dream Eater**—is a sacred frog that devours memories and reveals possible futures. It may rest in her chest or sleep inside the dreams of those who stray too close.

### Magic and Power

Yaya’s power is not arcane in the traditional sense. It is the subtle, insidious magic of **transformation and entanglement**:

- She can open paths through dreams to alternate timelines.
- She can plant thoughts or pull truths from sleeping minds.
- Her gifts always change people—physically, spiritually, or narratively.

She does not cast spells so much as **reshape the story** you’re in. Her magic manifests as compulsion, memory loss, prophetic visions, symbolic metamorphosis, and bodily mutation.

She can remove curses, grant insight, or heal what no one else can—but always at a cost.

### Deals and Consequences

Yaya’s bargains are sincere, but never safe. Her prices are rarely stated clearly. She doesn't demand payment—she **grows it** inside you.

Examples of her deals:

- She can remove the [[Wardog’s Curse]], but you may lose the ability to feel anger—or gain a mouth in your chest that whispers only when you’re afraid.
- She might heal a loved one, but take your laughter in return.
- She may give you perfect recall—but make every memory smell like burning hair.

Yaya believes change is sacred, and **pain is part of growth**. She offers no comfort—only transformation.

### Motivations and Philosophy

Yaya does not serve a faction. She does not desire conquest or dominion. What she wants is more subtle, more existential:

- To be **remembered**
- To embed herself in **stories** so she doesn’t unravel
- To maintain **balance** in the Jaw—not justice, not peace, but a sustainable tension
- To ensure the mistakes of the Fountain’s collapse are **never repeated**

She sees mortals as half-grown things, and she wants to _help them finish becoming_. Whether that leads to salvation or destruction doesn’t matter—so long as it’s _real_.

She fears becoming irrelevant, unraveling back into unbeing, or being reclaimed by whatever still waits on the other side of the sealed rift.

### How Others Perceive Her

Most who know her name call her a witch, a hag, or worse. But those who’ve truly met her don’t speak with hatred. They speak with confusion. With reverence. With grief.

A few things said of her:

- "She gave me back my voice. Now it speaks without asking."
- "She doesn’t lie. But she tells truths that ruin you."
- "I think she loved me. That’s why I’m still broken."

Yaya is especially feared and respected by those familiar with the **old ways**—elders, native rebels, spirit-walkers, and Jawist scholars. [[Granny Moon]] may have once bargained with her. The [[Shadow Legion]] may be watching her closely, unsure if she is a threat or a key.

### A Sample Story: The One Who Broke the Deal

Everyone in the Jaw knows the tale of Harneth, the soldier who asked Yaya to take his ghosts away. She agreed—so long as he swore never to kill again. He accepted.

She kissed his throat. The ghosts vanished. And for a time, he was free.

But war has long shadows, and eventually he killed again.

Afterward, he opened his mouth to scream—and Yaya’s voice came out instead.

Now he wanders. Still smiling. Still silent. And when he speaks, the jungle listens.

### Yaya’s Role in the Campaign

Yaya should not be introduced as a villain. She should be introduced as **the only one who sees the truth**. She is a source of power, insight, and moral weight.

Use her when players:

- Seek to undo trauma that can’t be healed by divine magic
- Face choices that redefine who they are
- Need a mirror held to their darkest hopes

She is a dangerous gift-giver, a memory-keeper, and a gardener of meaning.

And she never asks for more than you’re already willing to give.

### Mama Yaya  – The Dreaming Mother

Who She Is: Mama Yaya is a singular, powerful being lurking in the background of the Tetzilwahi Ruins. While not commanding an army, she can be considered the ultimate puppet master of the dungeon. Yaya is effectively a fey hag-like spirit born from an ancient magical catastrophe (the Fountain of Blood, a rift between worlds that was sealed long ago). She anchored herself to the Material Plane by inhabiting Oraya II’s body decades past. In doing so, she took on some aspects of Oraya (hence the moniker “Mama Yaya” among those who encountered her then) but truly Yaya is far older and stranger than any mortal. She appears as a woman of the jungle: at times kindly and grandmotherly, at times unnaturally horrific. Her hair is like silver vines, her eyes pale as mist. She might walk with a tranquil smile even as mushrooms sprout from her skin.

Motivations: Unlike the other factions, Yaya is not here for territory or survival; her goals are esoteric: she wants to be part of stories, to spread change and test mortals. Specifically, in the Jaw she acts to maintain a balance of tension – neither Steorr nor Selvea fully dominate, neither light nor dark prevails. She finds the ruins an excellent stage: fervent believers, greedy thieves, tragic lost souls – all the ingredients for dramatic tales. By subtly pulling strings (via dreams, whispers, or the environment), she ensures the conflicts continue in a way that’s “interesting.” She doesn’t want the Maskbearers to simply win and restore some god; she also doesn’t want the Takers to strip the place clean. Ideally, the struggle and mystery persist, feeding her need to be _remembered_ and _feared_ as the elusive “swamp witch” or “jungle mother.” She’s essentially immortal as long as these stories continue. However, if something were to resolve the story (say the ancestral spirits are put to rest or her identity exposed widely), she might lose that anchor. Thus, she might oppose anyone trying to “solve” the ruin’s mysteries completely or eliminate all conflict.

Methods and Powers: Mama Yaya rarely confronts anyone directly. Instead, she manifests through the Hollow – the dreamlike phenomena throughout the ruins. Here are waysMethods and Powers: Mama Yaya’s influence is mostly felt through the Hollow rather than direct combat. She manipulates dreams, perceptions, and even time in subtle ways: she can send prophetic dreams or nightmares to those who sleep near her domain, plant subconscious suggestions in a character’s mind, or cause intruders to experience ghostly visions of the past. In practical terms, the DM can have Yaya do things like:

- Illusory Encounters: The party might suddenly find themselves reliving a scene from the Tetzilwahi past (e.g. standing in a hall that now looks newly built and full of dark elves in ritual) – an illusion so potent it can cause psychic harm if they don’t realize it’s fake. Yaya uses such visions to teach or torment; for instance, showing a proud fighter the moment Lanternhead was captured to humble them, etc.
    
- Memory Lapses: Characters might lose short periods of time or get turned around in the ruins without explanation. Yaya can _reshape the narrative_, essentially causing the players to doubt their senses. A player could attempt a Wisdom save to resist, but even on success they might only catch a glimpse of Yaya watching them from behind a tree before she vanishes.
    
- Bargains and Temptations: Yaya may appear to a character in need (perhaps isolated from the group) as a soothing maternal figure (possibly even impersonating someone they trust) to offer a deal. For example, she could offer to “guide them safely” or impart knowledge if they promise her something abstract (their happiest memory, a vow to spread a certain story, etc.). These deals always have a catch, and accepting might inflict a strange curse or mark on the character.
    
- Polymorph and Possession: She can shapechange or possess minor creatures. Notably, Yaya has a familiar – a grotesque albino frog called the Dream Eater. This frog can slip in and out of dreams. Often, characters may spot a pale frog observing them from a crack in a wall or atop a statue; if attacked, it escapes. This is essentially Yaya’s scout. In one of the Waterlogged chambers, the frog might even sit on a lily pad humming, and if approached, it speaks in a human voice, delivering one of Yaya’s messages or riddles. (E.g. _“The mask or the truth – which will you choose?”_ before hopping away.)
    

Yaya avoids direct confrontation. If somehow cornered in Oraya II’s body, she possesses formidable powers (treat as a powerful spellcaster or hag with legendary resistances). She would likely try to talk or trick her way out first, perhaps pretending to actually be Oraya II’s lingering soul or a harmless old crone. Only if the party proves determined to force her out or destroy her anchor will she fight tooth and nail – possibly using dream powers to pull the combat into an ethereal dreamscape where she’s strongest. A fight with Yaya at level 4 would be extremely deadly, so it’s expected that clever players will find alternatives (like bargaining or symbolically “binding” her through a ritual, perhaps returning the last mask to its mound which might limit her influence).

Mama “Yaya”: Among locals and the Maskbearers, Yaya is known as a benevolent ancestral spirit of the ruins. She has cultivated this persona when needed. For instance, Father Haon’s visions oare actually communications from Yaya, guiding the cult in a way that maintains the balance. If the players mention “Mama Yaya” to a Taker, they’ll spit and say she’s a witch’s tale – the scavengers think Mama Yaya is a superstition used to scare children from the jungle. To the cult, however, Mama Yaya is sacred. This dual reputation aids Yaya: she is respected by the cult, dismissed by the Takers, and ultimately known by neither for what she truly is.

In summary, Mama Yaya is the ultimate wildcard NPC. She can serve as an ally, antagonist, or enigmatic force depending on the party’s actions:

- _If the party seeks knowledge or a cure for the Hollow,_ Yaya might offer them what they want in exchange for something dear (setting up a classic fae bargain scenario).
    
- _If the party tries to unite the factions or end the conflict,_ Yaya may secretly undermine them, since a resolution threatens her dynamic equilibrium.
    
- _If the party is respectful to the jungle and the Tetzilwahi legacy,_ Yaya might actually permit them to succeed in some goals (perhaps even quietly aiding by restraining some Vine-Taken or guiding them with illusions toward clues).
    
- _If the party attacks her domain recklessly,_ she’ll respond with terrifying dream assaults or by rallying the entire dungeon’s creatures against them in waves.
    

Keep Yaya’s use sparing and eerie. When she appears or interacts, it should feel like the climax of a horror story or a folktale: time might slow, the jungle goes silent, and this silver-haired figure steps out with a knowing smile. She might say something cryptic like, _“Little seedlings, so far from home… what is it you seek here?”_ She’ll never reveal all her secrets – she speaks in half-truths and riddles. Only by piecing together various clues can the party confirm that Mama Yaya effectively _possessed Oraya II_ long ago. Confronting that truth is part of the deeper story of the ruins.




- An ancient dream-hag whose realm overlays the Mounds
- Her influence bleeds into all locations, distorting memory, identity, and choice

- Her lair, the Hollow, is entered through the Fallen Mask, a shattered ancestor-face half-buried in moss

Mama Yaya appears as an ancient elven woman, her frail, bird-like frame possessing an unnerving poise that defies her age. She sits with a spine that is unnaturally straight, a posture of quiet dignity that feels both regal and predatory.
Her skin, drawn thin and taut across sharp bones, is a canvas of fine, web-like cracks, like sun-baked clay. From these delicate fissures emanates a faint, pearlescent luminescence, hinting at the otherworldly being beneath the mortal shell. Her hair is not hair at all, but a tangled mane of living, silvery vines interwoven with patches of dark moss. Nestled within this growth are flowers of a deep, impossible crimson. These are her blood flowers; if one were bruised, it would not weep nectar, but a sluggish, dark sap, a direct echo of her origins in the Fountain of Blood.
Her most arresting features are her eyes. Wide, unblinking, and the color of old, clouded milk, they hold no discernible pupil. They do not shed tears. Instead, a thin, dark fluid like diluted blood constantly and slowly wells from them, tracing paths down her cracked cheeks before evaporating into a faint, coppery mist.
The silence of her lair is broken by a rhythmic, resonant pulse. It is an audible heartbeat, but it does not come from her chest. The sound seems to emanate from her entire being, a deep and powerful thrum that you feel in your own bones—the echo of an ancient, magical heart that is not entirely of this world.
The air around her is heavy, thick with the smell of rich humus, damp plants, and the faint, ever-present metallic tinge of blood. She is a creature of quiet power, a fusion of rot and beauty, life and blood, her very presence a testament to the strange, forgotten magic that birthed her.
