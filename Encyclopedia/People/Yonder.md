Certainly! Here's a detailed description of Yonder, the young Guildless Halfling woman who guides the party through the Undercity:

**Appearance:**
Yonder is a petite Halfling woman in her early twenties, with a wiry build and quick, agile movements. Her dark hair is cut short and practical, often tucked under a worn, wide-brimmed hat. Her clothing is a mix of patched-up leather armor and dark, nondescript garments that allow her to blend into the shadows of the Undercity. Her eyes are a bright, piercing blue, and she has a small scar on her left cheek, a memento from a past encounter with Undercity dangers.

**Personality:**
Yonder is a survivor, quick-witted and resourceful. Growing up in the Undercity has made her street-smart and cautious, with a keen sense of danger and a talent for improvisation. She's fiercely independent and self-reliant, having learned early on that trust is a luxury in the unforgiving world of the Guildless.

Despite her rough exterior, Yonder has a strong sense of loyalty to her fellow Guildless. She's protective of her community and will go to great lengths to ensure their safety. While initially guarded around outsiders, she can warm up to those who prove themselves trustworthy and compassionate.

Yonder has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, often using it as a defense mechanism in tense situations. She's not afraid to speak her mind and will call out injustice or hypocrisy when she sees it, especially when it comes to the treatment of the Guildless by the upper echelons of Siblín society.

**Motivations:**
Yonder's primary motivation is survival - for herself and for her fellow Guildless. She dreams of a day when the Guildless are treated with respect and given equal opportunities within Siblín society. She sees the party's infiltration of the Sunrise Winery as a chance to strike a blow against the corrupt power structures that oppress her people.

Yonder is also driven by a desire for knowledge and understanding. Having grown up in the Undercity, she's fascinated by the world above and is always eager to learn more about it. She sees the party as a source of new information and experiences, and may hope to use her connection with them to gain insights into the workings of the surface world.

**Interactions with the Party:**
Yonder will initially be cautious around the party, sizing them up to determine their intentions and trustworthiness. She'll be direct and to the point, with little patience for nonsense or deception. As the party proves themselves reliable allies, Yonder will begin to open up more, sharing her knowledge of the Undercity and her insights into Siblín society.

Yonder will be an invaluable guide through the twists and turns of the Undercity, her keen senses and quick thinking helping the party navigate its dangers. She'll also serve as a bridge between the party and the Guildless community, helping them to understand and empathize with the struggles of those living on the margins.

In combat, Yonder will favor quick, stealthy attacks, darting in and out of the shadows to strike at enemies. She'll prioritize protecting her allies and will not hesitate to put herself in harm's way to keep them safe.

Overall, Yonder is a complex and multi-faceted character, shaped by her experiences in the Undercity but driven by a desire for a better life for herself and her fellow Guildless. Her interactions with the party will be a source of both tension and growth, as she learns to trust and rely on others in her fight for justice and equality.
