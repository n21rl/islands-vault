He is a crusty elderly Tortle who has been living on the island since before it was named [[New Destiny]] by Steorrian explorers.  He possesses a vast wealth of knowledge about his craft and has a rivalry with Valeria of Sticks and Stones, with whom he competes for ingredients that she prefers to use as spell components. He is rumoured to also dabble in poison-making.
