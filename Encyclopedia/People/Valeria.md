Valeria is a [[Republic|Republic]] elven shopkeeper at the magic shop [[Shops of the Republic v1#Spellcasting Sticks and Stones|Sticks and Stones]] on [[New Destiny]]. She has long coppery white hair that she keeps tied back in a braid, and her piercing blue eyes seem to sparkle with inner magic. Valeria is patient and friendly, always willing to help customers find the perfect spell components for their needs.  She has a rivalry with Lungwort, with whom she competes for ingredients that he prefers to use in his potions.
