Kawrl is the introverted Birdfolk lookout  of [[Crew]] who dies their head feathers blue and like to spend their time in the crow's nest. They fell to the deck after getting hit by an arrow fired by [[Viktor]]'s crew when the Asteroidea first arrived to Otarky. [[Liv]] nursed them back to health, but they lost the ability to fly. The are still able to glide however.
