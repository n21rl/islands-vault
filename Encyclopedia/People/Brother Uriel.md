Brother Uriel is a young blond-headed missionary from the [[Church of the Unwavering Star]]. Based on [[Mission]], he was sent to proselytise in the [[Northern Scattered Isles]] and was captured by [[The Bards]]. The pirates discovered he was gifted with healing magic, so they used his power during battle. They then ransomed him back to Mission for 500 gold.
