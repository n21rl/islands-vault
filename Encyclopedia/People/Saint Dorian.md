### **Saint Dorian and the First Corona**

The Church teaches that **Saint Dorian was the purest of men**, untouched by sin, doubt, or corruption. It is said that **his faith burned so brightly that no temptation could take root within him**, that he was **a vessel of divine will, unblemished and eternal**. But the truth—if there is any truth left—suggests something else.

Some forbidden texts hint that **Dorian was not naturally incorruptible, but had found a way to make himself so**. The stories vary: some say he forged a relic, others that he was given it, and still others claim that he simply discovered a truth no man was meant to wield. Regardless, **at some point, Dorian placed a band of iron upon his head, and from that moment forward, he never wavered again**.

- Where others struggled with **temptation**, he was **unshaken**.
- Where others faltered under **doubt**, he moved forward without hesitation.
- Where others **suffered**, he stood **unburdened**.

It was a miracle. **It was perfection.**

And yet, those closest to him spoke of a change. He **laughed less, smiled rarely, seemed distant even in conversation**. There was a hollowness to his conviction, a sense that though he preached of faith, **he no longer felt it himself, only knew it as an intellectual truth**.

### **The Inheritance of the Corona**

Dorian **disappeared** before his death, and the original corona was **lost, sealed away, or perhaps deliberately hidden**. But his followers had seen its effect, and they sought to replicate it. They crafted new bands of iron in his image, believing that **if faith could be locked into a man’s soul, then surely others could attain his purity as well**.

Thus began the first trials of what would become **the Coronas of St. Dorian**. The first wearers **did not receive clarity or peace, but agony**. The iron burned, their minds writhed, their thoughts became rigid and singular. The early Church declared that this was **proof of the corona’s power**, that suffering was merely the cost of excising weakness.

And so, over generations, it became a rite—**a mark of devotion**, a way to **bind inquisitors permanently to their faith**. Few question why **Saint Dorian himself felt nothing, while they suffer with every breath**.

### **What Happened to the Original?**

If the first Corona—the true Corona—still exists, what would it be now?

- If it works like **Dorian Gray’s portrait**, it may be **a decayed, rotting thing**, warped by centuries of absorbing corruption.
- If someone were to **place it upon their head**, would they **inherit everything Saint Dorian cast away?**
- Does the **Church still possess it?** Or did they **seal it away, afraid of what it might reveal?**
- **If Dorian did not bear his own flaws, then where did they go? Who, or what, is carrying them still?**

### **A Doctrine Built on a Lie**

If Saint Dorian’s **perfection was not achieved but displaced**, then what does that mean for the inquisitors who bear his coronas today?

- Were they ever meant to be purified?
- Or are they **repositories for sin**, vessels crafted not to remove impurity, but to contain it?
- Are they wearing **symbols of faith**, or **shackles designed to keep them from ever looking beyond the role they have been forced into?**

The Church will never admit this. But if the truth were ever uncovered, if someone were to **find the original Corona and wear it once more**, then perhaps, at long last, **Saint Dorian’s sins would finally return home.**
