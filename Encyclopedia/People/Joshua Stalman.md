Joshua Stalman, son of Vlad Stalman, is the current head of the Hammer. His grandfather was a Steorr noble. The family fell out of the governor's favour for too aggressive ideas, and with that the family fortune crumbled. His father tried to get the family back up with trade and a little of weapon tech investments. He was too stubborn to admit the Steorrian control of the Jaw was crumbling so the annexation dealt a great hit to the family. The man got sick and over 6 years first gave control to his son Joshua and then died 3 years prior to current events. Joshua Stalman embraced the semi legal position of his house and sees themself as a beacon of hope for Steorrians.
