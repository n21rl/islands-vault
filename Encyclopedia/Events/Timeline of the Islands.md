# Timeline of the Islands (Suggested Table)

This is a working, GM-facing synthesis of major historical beats drawn from notes across the Encyclopedia.  
Dates use the Steorrian calendar (Star Years, SL) where known; earlier eras are expressed as “Pre‑Star” or broad ranges.  
Columns split events loosely between the continental **Old Lands** and the **Islands** archipelago (including Selvea, the Jaw, Siblín, and the pirate Republic).

> _c._ marks approximate dating based on current notes, not fixed canon.

| Date / Era                           | Old Lands (Steorr, Old Lands, diaspora)                                                                                         | Islands (Selvea, Jaw, Siblín, Republic, seas)                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre‑Star mythic age (“Darkness”)     | Proto‑peoples and clans exist in what will later be called the Old Lands; no unified states yet.                                | Ancient spirits and powers (including early sea gods like **Tanawhu**) are venerated; proto‑Jawist and other island cultures emerge.                                                                      |
| Ancient Old Selvea (Pre‑Star)        | —                                                                                                                               | **[[Old Selvea]]** rises around the **[[Fountain of Blood]]**, whose faerie tear grants elves long life and power. Blood‑sacrifice becomes the core of state, religion, and culture.                      |
| Ancient Old Selvea – Natzli’s rise   | —                                                                                                                               | **Natzli** becomes High Priest of the Fountain, guiding Old Selvea through blood‑rites and soft power (Servitors, Laced Concords) across surrounding islands.                                             |
| Ancient Old Selvea – Collapse        | —                                                                                                                               | A catastrophic attempt to deepen the Fountain’s power leads to the **Collapse of the Fountain of Blood**; magic fractures, elves age and die in waves, and Old Selvea begins to fall into ruin.           |
| Ancient Old Selvea – Great Burning   | —                                                                                                                               | In the aftermath, Selvean rulers order the **[[Great Burning]]**, destroying records of the Fountain, blood mathematics, and much of Old Selvea’s history to erase the catastrophe and its cause.         |
| Post‑Collapse diaspora (Pre‑Star)    | Elven refugees from Old Selvea sail west and establish new communities on the continent later known as the **[[Old Lands]]**.   | Remnants of Old Selvea, its ruins and jungle heartlands, are left behind; stories of the Fountain become fractured myth.                                                                                  |
| 0 SL – Appearance of the Star        | The **[[Unwavering Star]]** appears in the sky; the Steorrian calendar begins.                                                  | The Star becomes visible above the Islands as well, though its political significance is initially centred in the Old Lands.                                                                              |
| 1–35 SL – Astron’s youth             | **Saint Astron** is born in the Old Lands; grows as warrior and lawgiver among feuding clans.                                   | —                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 16 SL – Church established           | Formal establishment of the **Church of the Unwavering Star**.                                                                  | —                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35 SL – Founding of Steorr           | Astron unites the clans; the **Kingdom of Steorr** is founded on the Old Lands (see [[Steorr]]).                                | —                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 0–100 SL – Astronic Era              | Astron reigns as first monarch; Concord of noble clans formed; Church and Crown intertwined.                                    | —                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 100–600 SL – Early Steorrian eras    | Concord‑Kingship, Caerwyn dynasty, Interregnum (Concord rule), Elowen‑Velador Restoration, Temple War between Crown and Church. |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 665–994 SL – Expansion abroad        | Steorr becomes a bureaucratic monarchy; Church acts as missionary arm for colonial ventures.                                    | Explorers and scholars hear rumours of distant archipelagos; elven and island cultures continue independently of Steorr.                                                                                  |
| 1000 SL – Star Millennium            | Steorr celebrates 1000 years since the Star’s appearance.                                                                       | —                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1015 SL – First expedition           | First major Steorrian naval expedition sails toward the Unwavering Star; it is lost.                                            | —                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1028 SL – Fourth expedition launched | Another expedition sets sail with Church backing, seeking the Star and new lands.                                               | **Pre‑contact Islands**: indigenous cultures, Selvean power, and local polities exist without Steorrian presence.                                                                                         |
| 1029 SL – Discovery of the Islands   | Steorrian explorers, guided by the Star, sight land; Old Lands discover the archipelago.                                        | The **[[Islands]]** are “discovered” by Steorr; landfall at what becomes **[[Landfall]]**. Later that year, **[[New Bæcon]]** is founded on the Grand Isle as colonial capital.                           |
| 1031 SL – Star Point founded         | —                                                                                                                               | Settlement of **[[Star Point]]** on the eastern tip of the Grand Isle, the closest Steorrian colonists have come to the Star; later home to the great Cathedral.                                          |
| 1029–1050 SL – Early colonisation    | Steorr ships, settlers, and officials depart from the Old Lands in growing numbers.                                             | Steorr establishes control over parts of **Grand Isle**, **Crater Isle**, and **Jagged Isle**, placing forts, missions, and towns amid existing indigenous and Selvean‑aligned powers.                    |
| c. 1050–1100 SL – First Selvean War  | Steorr’s expansion sparks conflict with **Selvea**; the **First Selvean War** begins (see Steorrian Timeline).                  | Fighting centres on control of **[[Helis]]** and surrounding territories; Selvean and Steorrian forces clash across parts of the archipelago.                                                             |
| 1099 SL – Star Point Cathedral       | —                                                                                                                               | The great cathedral of the Unwavering Star in **Star Point** is completed, cementing Steorrian religious presence in the Islands.                                                                         |
| 1147 SL – Second Selvean War         | Steorr and Selvea go to war again after years of tension.                                                                       | The **Second Selvean War** engulfs regions including the Jaw, Helis, and other contested holdings.                                                                                                        |
| 1165 SL – Harboursjaw Treaty         | Steorr seeks peace to consolidate its remaining colonial empire.                                                                | By the **[[Harboursjaw Treaty]]**, Steorr cedes the **[[Jaw]]** (including [[Harboursjaw]]) to Selvea; Steorrian control of other colonial holdings in the Islands is recognised.                         |
| c. 1165–1180 SL – Jaw under Selvea   | Steorr remains a major power in the Old Lands under the Ferrinite Era monarchy.                                                 | Selvea governs the Jaw as a province; Steorrian settlers remain in place. **[[Paxitli]]** is installed as Envoy; **[[Tzecto]]** commands Champions and begins building the clandestine **Shadow Legion**. |
| Ferrinite Era (c. 1100s–present)     | Queen Celaveth and later King Ferrin III centralise royal power; the Concord is stripped of political authority.                | Steorrian colonial and naval policy in the Islands is driven from Hafensted; Church retains cultural sway but less direct political control.                                                              |
| c. 1170s SL – Siblín Triarch Works   | Steorrian merchants and guild connections invest in overseas trade with the Islands.                                            | The guild‑ruled city of **[[Siblín]]** undertakes the **[[Triarch Ring]]** project, binding [[Áine]], [[Ben]], and [[Cad]] with massive sea walls and locks, reshaping politics and currents.             |
| 1179 SL – Wesson ledger events       | Steorrian officials and merchants (Bowes, Strongboot, etc.) transact extensively with Siblín guilds (see [[Wesson Ledger]]).    | Plots around **Vintage**, the **Wesson** family, and the Board unfold in Siblín; quests like **[[The Easons Quest]]** and **[[The Steorrian People's tolll]]** expose Guild–Guildless tensions.           |
| c. 1170s–1180s SL – Jaw “edge” era   | Steorr watches Jaw politics closely, balancing colonial interests and Church concerns.                                          | Events of **[[A Province on the Edge]]**: convoys like **[[The Envoy's Convoy]]**, rising Jawist movements, and Shadow Legion schemes push the Jaw toward either reconciliation or renewed war.           |
| c. late 1100s SL – Pirate Republic   | Steorrian admirals and governors (e.g. **[[Gideon Fletcher]]**) struggle to contain piracy and unrest in the Northern Isles.    | Pirate crews found the **Republic** on **[[New Destiny]]**, sign the **[[Pirate Code]]**, and establish a council of founding captains (e.g. [[Luna Mahina]], [[Captain Morgan]], [[Calico Jack]]).       |
| c. late 1100s SL – Republic arcs     | —                                                                                                                               | Story elements such as **Missions for the Republic**, **Republic's Navy**, mapping efforts, trade and diplomatic relations, and votes like **Republic's Vote on Elisabeth Grey joining** unfold.          |
| Current campaign years (open)        | Steorr remains an Old Lands superpower; internal politics in Hafensted and the Church continue to evolve.                       | Ongoing campaigns (Islands piracy, Jaw politics, Siblín intrigues) play out against this backdrop; Tanawhu’s cults and echoes of the Fountain (Natzli, the Drowsy One) continue to surface in the Isles.  |
