## The Astronic Era (Year 0–98)

Government: Sacred Monarchy under the First Flamebearer
Church–Crown Relation: Spiritual harmony; Church forming under Astron’s shadow

The appearance of the Unwavering Star heralds the rise of Saint Astron, born of Clan Steorr, possibly the product of two enemy clans reconciled by prophecy. Raised in seclusion, guided by advisors—including the mysterious Myrddin—he becomes a warrior, lawgiver, and unifier.

At age thirty, Astron seeks a fallen fragment of the Star. With the help of Saint Weland, the smith, he forges Hardblade, a blade said to resonate only with the worthy.

After the Battle of the Hollow Pass, where Astron leads a vastly outnumbered force to victory, his kingship is recognized by the Twelve Concordant Clans, including human, dwarven, elven, and halfling lineages.

He reigns as monarch—not by divine right, but by burden and duty—until his disappearance around Year 98, after a final campaign leaves him mortally wounded. He sails east to the island where he once found the shard of the Star and passes through a rift. Some say he kept sailing toward the Star itself.


Legacy:
Astron’s reign becomes the model of righteous leadership. The Concord, a council of noble Houses, is preserved as his advisory body. The Church of the Unwavering Star, formalized during his reign, enshrines him as its first Saint—but never a god.


## The Concord-Kingship (98–143)

Government: Elective monarchy chosen by the Concord
Church–Crown Relation: Partnership, with Church gaining intellectual and clerical authority

Following Astron’s disappearance and the absence of an heir, the Concord agrees to choose monarchs by consensus.

King Edrin I of House Meredyn is elected—a dignified but unremarkable figure. He establishes ceremonial continuity.

The Concord seeks balance among Houses of different races and regions, but rivalries quietly grow.

The Church’s influence expands, as it begins shaping education, scripture, and law—interpreting Astron’s teachings more authoritatively than the Crown.



## The Caerwyn Dynasty and the Crown’s Supremacy (143–267)

Government: Hereditary monarchy
Church–Crown Relation: Crown-dominant

House Caerwyn seizes the throne under King Hallen I, using military force and a claimed vision from the Star.

Church officials initially resist, but Hallen grants them new lands and temples, securing conditional support.

His grandson, Maedor the Bright, presides over a golden age of royal construction and scripture compilation—many Church texts from this era subtly favor royalist theology.

By the reign of Halric the Pale, tensions rise again. He dies without an heir, plunging the realm into civil war.


## The War of Concordant Tears & Interregnum (267–385)

Government: Council rule by the Concord
Church–Crown Relation: Church-dominant during early Interregnum, then neutral

The War of Concordant Tears sees noble houses—including Elowen, Corvale, and Tharazim (dwarven)—compete for control.

No side prevails. In 310, the monarchy is abolished. The Concord rules directly in a rotating council—the “Crown of Many.”

Early in the Interregnum, the Church becomes the de facto stabilizing power, naming “Custodians of the Faith” to govern border regions.

However, noble infighting and Church overreach lead to disillusionment. By 385, military threats and internal unrest demand a stronger ruler.





## The Elowen-Velador Restoration (385–610)

Government: Restored monarchy; new foreign dynasty
Church–Crown Relation: Harmonized, with Church empowered and institutionalized

Queen Aleryn I of House Elowen defeats raiders and rebels and is crowned with Concord and Church blessing.

Her marriage to Prince Vaeril of Velador, a Star-faith elven kingdom, fuses the two realms. The Elowen-Velador Dynasty begins.

The monarchy revives with Church approval; the Treaty of Twelve Halls formalizes a new balance of power between Crown, Concord, and Church.

Royal court culture flourishes with elven influence; noble Houses diversify, including halfling trade-princes and dwarven magistrates.





## The Temple War and Theocratic Challenge (610–665)

Government: Strong monarchy facing ecclesiastical rebellion
Church–Crown Relation: Church resists royal overreach

King Deran III declares the Crown Primacy Doctrine—that the monarch interprets Astron’s will, not the clergy.

The Church fractures. Several provinces, led by House Tharazim and the Purified Flame Order, rebel.

The resulting Temple War ends with royal victory, but at great cost. Some Church powers are disbanded; others are co-opted into royal bureaucracy.





## Expansion and Theocratic Rebalancing (665–994)

Government: Bureaucratic monarchy
Church–Crown Relation: Equilibrium, then Crown ascendance

Steorr begins projecting its power abroad, launching the first colonial expeditions to the Islands under King Maeron IX.

The Church acts as missionary force, blessing the conquest as a spiritual mission.

At home, Concord authority wanes, and the Church is subsumed into the Crown’s legal apparatus—a reversal of the Temple War’s aftermath.

Church bureaucrats become royal magistrates; theology increasingly serves state ideology.




## The Ferrinite Era and Modern Absolutism (994–Present)

Government: Absolute monarchy
Church–Crown Relation: Institutional separation; Church independent but subordinate

Queen Celaveth the Solemn strips the Concord of all political power and codifies The Royal Law of Flame, which frames monarchy as “executor of Saint Astron’s vision.”

Her descendant, King Ferrin III, rules at the time of the campaign from Hafensted.

The Church is now an independent religious body, with no direct control over governance. It retains influence over culture, morality, and education, but its role as political powerbroker has waned.
