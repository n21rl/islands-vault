#### **1. Steorrian Beginnings – The Mining Boom**

- When **Steorr first settled the Jaw**, they **established Isernholt as a mining colony**, drawn by **rich iron deposits in the mountains**.
- The town thrived as **iron ore was extracted and shipped south**, fueling Steorrian **foundries, shipyards, and blacksmithing industries**.
- Mining operations were **aggressive and expansionist**, with tunnels and **deep shafts carved into the mountains**.
- At its height, Isernholt had **strong fortifications, warehouses, and a steady influx of settlers**.

#### **2. Decline Under Steorrian Rule – Iron Drying Up**

- Over time, **the iron deposits proved shallower than expected**, and production **declined**.
- As **resources ran low**, some mines **collapsed**, some were **abandoned**, and others had to **dig deeper at great risk**.
- By the time of Steorr’s **later years in the Jaw**, Isernholt had already **peaked and was declining**, forcing many to **leave for better opportunities**.

#### **3. Selvean Annexation – A Change in Priorities**

- When **Selvea took control of the Jaw**, Isernholt fell under their rule but **iron was no longer a priority**.
- **Selveans prefer obsidian, jade, and volcanic stone** for weapons and tools—**iron was useful, but not essential**.
- **Investment dried up**, and Isernholt became **a backwater**—still populated, but **less connected to the heart of the Jaw economy**.
- With its **fortifications, old smelters, and abandoned mines**, it became a **shadow of its former self**.



### **Isernholt Today – A Town in Isolation**

- **Still a Northern Population Center:** Despite its decline, Isernholt remains **one of the few large settlements in the North of the Jaw**.
- **Dwindling Trade & Harsh Conditions:**
    - The town is **isolated**, cut off from larger trade hubs, relying on the **old river routes** and **mountain paths** for supplies.
    - Many buildings are **partially abandoned** or repurposed from old mining infrastructure.
- **Ruins of Steorrian Industry:**
    - **Defunct smelters and rusting equipment** litter the area, remnants of **its past prosperity**.
    - Old **fortified warehouses and bunkers** suggest Steorr once saw this town as **strategically important**.
- **Political and Social Tensions:**
    - Some **Steorrian descendants remain**, still **loyal to their old homeland**, while others have **assimilated into Selvean rule**.
    - **Selvean-appointed officials** oversee a town that **feels more Steorrian than Selvean**, leading to **cultural friction**.
- **What Keeps People Here?**
    - Some **still mine the weaker deposits**, scraping a living from **what’s left**.
    - Others have turned to **logging, hunting, or even banditry**, taking advantage of the town’s **isolation**.
    - 


### **Potential Story Hooks & Conflicts in Isernholt**

- **Old Mines, New Dangers:**
    - Something was **left behind in the deepest tunnels**—a **creature, a cursed artifact, or something the miners sealed away**.
- **Steorrian Loyalist Activity:**
    - With **Steorr gone**, some residents dream of **reclaiming their town from Selvea**, possibly **stoking rebellion**.
- **A Forgotten Resource?**
    - What if there’s **something else hidden in the mountains**—not iron, but **a rare magical stone, an ancient relic, or something Selvea overlooked**?



Here is a detailed recap of Isernholt's culture and politics.
Isernholt: Culture and Politics
Isernholt is a remote northern town in the Jaw, defined by its past as a prosperous Steorrian mining colony and its present as a neglected outpost under Selvean rule. This has created a unique, insular culture and a complex political landscape where the primary conflict is not between Steorrians and Selveans, but between competing Steorrian factions vying for the town's future.
Culture: A Fading Ember of Steorr
The town’s identity is fiercely Steorrian, rooted in its history of industry and tradition.
 * Physical Environment: The landscape is scarred by its past, with defunct smelters and rusting equipment littering the area. Old fortified warehouses and bunkers are remnants of when Steorr considered the town strategically important. Many buildings are partially abandoned or have been repurposed from the old mining infrastructure.
 * Local Traditions: The population consists mainly of Steorrian descendants who remain loyal to their old homeland. They maintain their heritage through unofficial festivals celebrating their mining history and by practicing a fervent, traditionalist form of worship of the Unwavering Star.
 * Distrust of Outsiders: The town is isolated and cut off from major trade hubs. This, combined with a general Steorrian disdain for magic, has fostered a deep suspicion of outside influences, particularly anything associated with Selvean culture.
Politics: A Town Divided
The political situation in Isernholt is a quiet powder keg. The official ruler is a Selvean-appointed governor, but she holds little real power over the deeply divided Steorrian factions who operate in the shadows.
The Puppet Governor
 * Lady Marion Etta: A Steorrian elf and former noble, Lady Etta serves as the Selvean-appointed governor. She was considered a pragmatic choice to help stabilize the region after the Selvean annexation. However, her authority is constantly undermined by various factions, leaving her as a puppet ruler trying to maintain order in a town that has slipped from anyone's control.
The Steorrian Factions
The local Steorrian population is split into two main ideological camps, creating significant internal friction.
 * The Steorrian Loyalists: This faction is composed of those who believe Isernholt's only path to prosperity is to be reunified with the Kingdom of Steorr. They represent the "old guard" of the town, likely the descendants of the families who grew wealthy during the mining boom. They view the Vanguard as dangerous traitors and work to preserve the old monarchical traditions.
 * The Steorrian Vanguard: This faction is made up of Steorrians who feel betrayed and abandoned by the monarchy that ceded the Jaw to Selvea. Their goal is to create a new, independent Steorrian state in the Jaw, free from both Selvean and old Steorrian rule. In Isernholt, they are the revolutionaries, recruiting from disillusioned miners and the younger generation. They secretly use one of the defunct mines to manufacture weapons for their cause.
The Shadow Legion: Covert Agitators
Unknown to the locals, the Selvean Shadow Legion, a secret military faction led by Tzecto, is actively working to destabilize the town. Their ultimate goal is to provoke a crisis so severe that it makes war between Selvea and Steorr inevitable.
 * Strategy: Their primary tactic in Isernholt is to manipulate the Steorrian Vanguard. They aim to secretly arm and misdirect the revolutionaries, pushing them into a direct and violent confrontation with Selvean authority.
 * Methods: Legion agents, likely working under deep cover, will employ several methods:
   * Divide and Radicalize: They will amplify the mistrust between the Loyalists and the Vanguard, ensuring the Steorrians remain too divided to form a united front.
   * Provoke an Incident: They will feed the Vanguard false intelligence or goad them into attacking a strategic target, like Paxitli's convoy. The goal is to create an incident that frames the Vanguard as aggressive terrorists, forcing a massive military crackdown from Tzecto's official forces.
