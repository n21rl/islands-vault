Sealtham is a major [[Steorr|Steorrian]] city tucked in a rocky fjord of the [[Jagged Isle]]. It is the only accessible harbour on the eastern end of the island and the main base for the [[Green Salt Trading Company]] in the Islands.

The [[Lord Mayor Brummb√§r]] is the local authority of Sealtham and oversees operations for the [[Green Salt Trading Company]]. His gated manor on a hill dominates the rest of the city, with its stoic and uniform architecture, focused on function over form. The muddy streets are lined with rows of cheaply built blocky houses, where the populace resides. The vast majority of people are employed by the Company, working as miners, refiners, packers or merchants. 

Surrounding the city, the [[Jagged Peaks]] are dotted with the massive pithead rigs of mines dug deep into the rocky ground. Carts haul ore and salt crystals down the mountain and between refineries and warehouses. Towering furnaces churn out plumes of acrid greenish smoke into the sky, where company banners flap in the breeze.

Most residents are covered in a sheen of sweat and dust at the end of gruelling shifts extracting and refining the precious mineral that fuels the colonial economy. Taverns allow off-shift miners and other workers to blow off steam. Placards stuck to the grimy walls surge increased productivity. A strong [[Steorrian army]] presence fills the role of a security force, ensuring no green salt goes unaccounted for.
