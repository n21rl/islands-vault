The Kitiri Trench is a vast undersea chasm where the evil squid god Tanawhu is said to be sealed away by the other sea deities. Its lightless depths are home to some of the most horrific sea monsters and eldritch abominations in the ocean. Many of these creatures are thought to be direct spawn of Tanawhu himself. Sea elves avoid the area entirely, fearing that their presence may weaken the divine seals restraining the dark god. Still, some particularly zealous followers of Tanawhu risk the trench's horrors to offer sacrifices that they hope will appease their god and bring about his return.
