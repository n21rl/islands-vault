To the north west, there is an island with a massive lake formed in the crater of an asteroid.
A large impact crater fills much of this remote northern island, flooded over time to create a massive circular lake. Only the elevated rim of the crater remains above water, dotted with small villages. The lakebed plunges to extraordinary depths filled with bioluminescent organisms and artifacts from the meteorite impact. Daring divers explore the underwater caverns.
