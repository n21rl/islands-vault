Similarly to the [[Southern Scattered Isles]], the Northern Scattered Isles are territories unclaimed by the main powers due to adverse conditions and resource scarcity. They are poorly mapped. 

The Northern Scattered Isles are a sparsely populated region of the archipelago, located to the north-east of the main. This isolated and rugged territory is known for its harsh climate, treacherous seas, and the presence of various dangerous creatures and phenomena.

The lack of a dominant governing authority in the region has made it a haven for pirates, smugglers, and other opportunistic groups seeking to evade the reach of the larger powers.
