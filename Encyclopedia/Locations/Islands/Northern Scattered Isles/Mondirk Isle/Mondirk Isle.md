Mondirk Isle is a small island in the Northern Scattered Isles, whose crescent shape surrounds a deep blue hole. The island features dense vegetation, and caves in the cliffs facing the hole.

Count DÃ¦dscu was an ambitious Steorrian explorer who sailed with one of the early expeditions to the Islands, approximately 100 years ago. Unlike his peers who were focused on colonization and resource extraction, Blackwater was drawn to the archipelago's mysteries. During his explorations, Blackwater discovered a massive blue hole in the sea. Fascinated by its depths and local legends, he became obsessed with uncovering its secrets. He was convinced that a great sunken city lay at the bottom, perhaps the remnants of an ancient civilization that once ruled the Islands.

Blackwater's obsession led him to make increasingly reckless dives into the blue hole, risking his life and the lives of his crew. He developed primitive diving equipment to explore the depths, remnants of which can still be found on the island.

On one of his dives, Blackwater encountered a mysterious entity that called itself the Voice of the Depths. This entity, unknown to Blackwater, was actually Tanawhu in disguise. Tanawhu, seeing an opportunity, played on Blackwater's ambitions, offering him extended life and dominion over an underwater realm if he would serve as its agent.

Blinded by the promise of power and the opportunity to explore the depths indefinitely, Blackwater agreed. The transformation was agonizing, stripping away Blackwater's humanity and replacing it with something inhuman and monstrous. He became a vampire, but one uniquely adapted to the ocean depths. His form became squid-like, allowing him to navigate the crushing pressures of the deep sea.

Now, Captain Blackwater lurks in the blue hole, no longer searching for a sunken city but instead creating his own macabre version - a city made from the bones of his victims. This Bone City is his twisted interpretation of the ancient city he once sought.

Blackwater and his vampire spawns primarily lure individuals rather than entire ships, making their operation more subtle and sustainable. They use the cave networks on the island as bases for their operations, luring victims into the caves before dragging them into the depths.

Each victim Blackwater claims feeds not only his own hunger but also provides life essence to Tanawhu. Unbeknownst to Blackwater, he is merely a pawn in Tanawhu's larger schemes.
