Island in the Northern Scattered Isles, where pirates have established a [[Encyclopedia/Groups/Republic/Republic|Republic]]. 
Nestled in the sheltered bay of a small northern island, New Destiny began as little more than a ramshackle outpost where pirates could lie low between raids. As more crews settled there over the decades, it grew into a thriving free port, where all are welcome regardless of background or occupation.

The settlement is a hodgepodge of driftwood structures along muddy lanes, surrounded by ships of all sizes crowded into the busy harbour. Taverns, shops and various services catering to pirates fill the main thoroughfares. Exotic goods and curios from across the Islands and beyond overflow from traders' stalls in the rowdy market square.

While ships load cargo and supplies for their next voyages, crews take advantage of the many taverns and pleasure houses. Laughter, shouts, and occasional brawls spill out into streets from establishments with colourful names like The Salty Wench, The Tipsy Barnacle, and The Mermaid's Embrace.

At the highest point of the island stands the Auction House, where pirates gather to appraise and bid on plundered treasure and magic. The most impressive pieces sell for small fortunes here, further enriching successful crews.

While rough around the edges, New Destiny cherishes freedom, self-determination, and mutual prosperity through trade. Flags from a hundred ships flutter over the town, symbolizing the diverse crews, once rivals, who now call this haven home. The port continues to adapt its haphazard structure to accommodate new vessels - it may look chaotic, but this is one place where everyone belongs.
