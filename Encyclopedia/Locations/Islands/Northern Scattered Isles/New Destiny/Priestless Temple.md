This temple is a simple stone building located on a small, wave-battered islet just off the coast of [[New Destiny]]. It can be accessed via a long suspended bridge.

No specific deity is associated with it. Instead, it contains idols, carvings, and relics representing a diverse array of gods and beliefs from across the Islands and beyond. No religious order or priest manages it and it welcomes visitors regardless of their faith or lack thereof. Pirates often come to pray or make offerings, especially seeking blessings from sea gods before voyages. They leave coins, flowers, incense, art, and other gifts.

The inclusive nature of the temple reflects the diversity of the pirates who come to New Destiny.
