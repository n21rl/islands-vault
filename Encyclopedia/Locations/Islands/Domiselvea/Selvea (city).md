Selvea technically refers to the largest city on the island of [[Domiselvea]], but the term is also used to refer to the island, the [[Organisations/Selvea/Selvea|country]], and its rulers.

Selvea is the capital city of the elven empire situated in the southern jungles of the large island of Domiselvea. The city's foundations arise from the tall mesas protruding above the jungle canopy, their sides carved into monumental tiered pyramids displaying the architectural ingenuity of its elven builders.

Connected by networks of glass-smooth roads and graceful arching bridges, the mesas host Selvea's neighbourhoods, temples, gardens and palaces. At their peaks, beacons of magical light illuminate the night, while below, the maze-like streets bustle with activity.

The imperial palace compound sprawls across multiple terraced levels, its soaring towers topped with dragon-headed spouts from which enchanted waterfalls pour into misty pools. Within the lavish chambers, the elven ruling family governs the empire, advised by priest-wizards who read cosmic signs.

Rafts laden with goods and passengers traverse the vast river networks, arriving at Selvea's harbours. There, carved longboats sail out to trade with coastal villages and foreign ships anchored just offshore, as the deeper jungle limits overland travel.

While incorporating outside influences through trade, Selvea zealously guards its magic bloodlines and ancient traditions. And atop its jungle-wreathed mesas, the elven capital's magnificence and esoteric beauty still beguile outsiders after centuries of prosperity.
