The Undercity encompasses the dark underground network of sewers and other water systems, as well as the catacombs located beneath Áine. Nowadays, it is largely flooded and only specialised workers and scoundrels know how to access and navigate it. 

Groups of the Undercity:

- Vintage operatives,
- Sanitation workers,
- Guard patrols unfamiliar with the location looking for [[Esmith Wesson]] and [[Calico Jack]]  
- [[Guildless]] : people on the margins of society that can't work or be part of a guild because of disability, criminal record, etc
- Smugglers
