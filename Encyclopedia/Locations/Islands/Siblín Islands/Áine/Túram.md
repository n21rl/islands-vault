The Túram is a a clock tower that rises above the [[Áine]]'s largest market square. This marvel of engineering bears numerous dials that indicate the time of day, date, the level of the tide, the predicted weather, the direction of the wind, and more useful information. 

Market square: **Cultural Centre**: The square gradually evolved into a cultural centre, hosting gatherings, markets, and festivals. It became a staple in local legends and stories, often associated with the deities Áine, Ben, and Cad. 

## Description 
Its base is robust, made of locally quarried granite, while the upper sections are adorned with intricate carvings and shimmering mosaics that catch the light.
## History

### The Old Áine Tower 
The site of the Túram was originally home to the Áine tower, erected during the early days of settlement on the island. This tower was a simple stone structure, built as a watchtower and a beacon for incoming ships. As the settlement around the tower grew into a bustling port, the tower became a symbol of unity and guidance, representing safety and welcome to travellers and traders. Over the years, the old Áine tower was expanded and adorned, reflecting the growing prosperity of the city. It housed a beacon fire, visible for miles, and served as a meeting point. 
### The Transformation into the Túram
A great fire eventually led to the destruction of the old Áine tower. New lighthouses had taken away some of its relevance, so the idea for the Túram was born – a structure that would  serve as a symbolic beacon and a marvel of engineering. 
Led by Ronan Chlog, the construction of the Túram was one of the first Board Grand Projects. It was a monumental effort, combining the skills of the finest members of multiple guilds. The new tower was designed to incorporate elements of the old tower's architecture as an homage to its legacy. The Túram was built with advanced mechanics and magical elements, far surpassing the old tower's capabilities. It was designed to serve as a timekeeper, weather predictor, and navigational aid, symbolizing the advancement and innovation of Áine.
### The Túram in Modern Times 
Today, the Túram stands not only as a functional edifice but also as a historical monument, embodying the spirit of the old Áine tower. Watching over the market square, it serves as a reminder of the city's journey from a humble settlement to a thriving center of commerce and culture.
