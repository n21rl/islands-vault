Named after the eldest of [[The Three Siblings]], Áine is the jewel of the [[Siblín Guilds]]. It is a city of craft, commerce, and culture that shines through the archipelago from the largest island in the Siblín triplet. It is one of the most densely populated places in the Islands. Facing an ever-growing number of inhabitants, and with no space to extend out, the city had to grow inwards. The buildings, mostly made of brightly painted stone and plaster, seem stacked on top of each other, covering the hills. Between them, Áine's labyrinthine streets weave their way to every corner of the island. Three main canals also flow through the city, dividing it into different quarters and connecting it to the sea at three busy harbours. The Trade Harbour is the largest in the Siblíns and the main port of entry for foreign ships. It is divided into different areas, with some reserved for ships belonging to members of the Siblín Guilds, and others for ships belonging to visitors from abroad. Each area is further divided into zones where different checks are carried out. Therefore, arriving ships may have to wait for a long time before being allowed to disembark and enter the city proper. 

The city is always bustling with activity, crowded with people and carts. The air is filled with the smells and sounds emanating from workshops and market stalls. Members of different guilds meet and debate in a multitude of guild houses. Locations are often named after the trades that dominate them, such as Potter's Corner, Lacy Lane, and Baker Street. 

The craftsmanship and prosperity of the Siblíns are visible in every detail of the architecture and environment. Besides the statues and fountains dotted around the city, several notable landmarks make Áine unique: the [[Túram]], the  [[Eólas Library]], the [[Great Guildhall]].

Áine is a city of contrasts and surprises, where every corner reveals something new and different. It is a city that guards its secrets and traditions, but also welcomes traders from all over and embraces innovation. It is a city of many layers, both literally and figuratively. One of these layers is the Overcity, a large collection of bridges and walkways that connect balconies and terraces among the tiled roofs. Over the most affluent area of Áine, the Overcity is mostly made of elegantly crafted glass platforms, home to hanging gardens and a [[Menagerie]] where rare and exotic plants and animals can be admired. More hidden, the Sidecity is a series of covered passages that connect different parts of the city. These alternative routes are often located above street-level, concealed by buildings or courtyards. Away from the elements and the crowds, the Sidecity forms an oasis of quiet unknown by most visitors. More secretive still, the Undercity encompasses the dark underground network of sewers and other water systems, as well as the catacombs located beneath Áine. Nowadays, it is largely flooded and only specialised workers and scoundrels know how to access and navigate it.
