The Green Veil is a Selvean-protected jungle zone where killing and damage are forbidden.
It was established after Steorrian colonization to allow the forest to heal from the devastation caused by settlers.
The trees themselves serve as sentinels, alerting Selvean guardians if someone violates the peace.
