The **Grand Mound** is like the sacred heart of the ruins—a source of spiritual, symbolic, and practical power. Each faction should project their own values onto it, seeing a different kind of truth or opportunity.

Here’s what it means to each of them:

### **Scavengers (Bonepickers)**

**Why they want it:**

- **Loot potential**: Rumors say the Grand Mound holds the last intact ceremonial chamber—filled with golden masks, obsidian blades, and relics untouched by looters.

- **Status symbol**: Controlling the center of the ruins means dominance; even the other scavenger groups would have to pay tribute.

- **Myth leverage**: Some Bonepickers want to sell fake “religious” stories tied to the mound, passing off forged artifacts as holy relics to outsiders or gullible pilgrims.

- **Camp advantage**: It’s the most defensible spot—elevated, central, with multiple tunnel and canopy routes.



### **Maskbearers**

**Why they want it:**

- **Spiritual Axis**: They believe the Grand Mound is the “Cradle of the Divine Mask”—where the first god-masks were birthed from the earth.

- **Ritual Convergence**: It sits at the intersection of jungle ley-lines (according to their flawed lore). They think completing a rite there will awaken the “true faces” of the ancestors.

- **Historic Redemption**: They seek to “cleanse” and reclaim it, believing the Tetzilwahi gods will only return when the Grand Mound is purified.

- **Cultural Legitimacy**: Controlling it would prove their claim as the true inheritors of the Tetzilwahi mantle—even if they misunderstand it.

### **Vine-Taken**

**Why they want it:**

- **Ancestral Root Source**: Their oldest roots grow from deep beneath the mound. They feel it “calls” them like a sleeping parent.

- **Nutrient Core**: The mound’s subterranean biomass is rich with decaying magic—feeding their growth, accelerating transformation.

- **Reclamation Goal**: They don’t want to occupy it—they want it to collapse and spread. Their perfect future is a Grand Mound overrun, indistinguishable from the jungle.

- **Memory Infection**: Its spiritual weight allows them to “seed” visions in others more effectively from here—making it a psychic broadcast point.
