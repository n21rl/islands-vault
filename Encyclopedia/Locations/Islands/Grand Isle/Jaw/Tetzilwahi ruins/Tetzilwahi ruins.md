The Tetzilwahi Mounds are the shattered remnants of a once-thriving treetop civilization of [[Tetzilwahi elves|drow]] who lived in sacred harmony with the jungle. These mounds were not only homes but living gods—vast, plant-like megastructures shaped by generations of caretaking, worship, and illusion magic. Once suspended high above the jungle floor, these towering biological temples have since collapsed into a maze of broken bridges, strangled roots, and desecrated memory.

Today, the ruins are fractured, haunted, and contested. Three primary factions vie for influence over different regions of the ruins, each interpreting the past through their own flawed lens. At the center lies the Grand Mound, the spiritual and strategic heart of the ruins—sought by all. 

The Tetzilwahi Mounds were towering, vine-covered structures that served as both the homes and religious centres of the [[Tetzilwahi elves|Tetzilwahi drow]], an elusive and feared people of the [[Jaw]]. These mounds were formed by a creeping and climbing species of vegetation, creating vast, interwoven chambers supported by rib-like root and branch structures. The Tetzilwahi believed the fully grown mounds were divine beings.

Now, the site is a twisted version of what it once was—warped by time, overgrowth, and the desecration of its current inhabitants. 

## Structure & Environment
Each mound could reach hundreds of feet into the sky, with bridges and woven pathways connecting them, creating  an entire society suspended under the canopy. The mounds were:

- Hollow on the inside, with vast, cavernous halls where families lived.
- Strengthened by tree-like roots, forming a natural, resilient skeletal system.
- Constantly tended to, with Tetzilwahi tenders nsuring their steady growth.
- Masked and honored, as each matured mound was considered a sacred guardian.

The mounds’ natural bioluminescent fungi provided eerie, flickering light in the darkness, while illusion magic was frequently used to obscure their entrances from outsiders.

## Religious & Cultural Significance
The Tetzilwahi did not simply live in these structures—they worshiped them. Each mound was considered a living god, and once it reached full maturity, it was given a mask crafted by the tribe’s artisans. These masks were ceremonial symbols of protection and wisdom, believed to channel the spirits of past generations.

Major life events—births, deaths, and rites of passage—were held within the great halls of the mounds, and the eldest members of the community often took on roles as caretakers and interpreters of the sacred spaces.

## Destruction & Fate
With the arrival of Steorrian forces in the Jaw, the Tetzilwahi mounds became targets of war. Seen as the strongholds of a raiding society, some of the structures were burned or felled by Steorrian expeditions.

It is unknown whether any of the sacred mounds survived or if they still grow in secret, hidden deep within the jungle. Some believe remnants of the Tetzilwahi may have returned, attempting to rekindle the old ways.

Whether the masked gods of the canopy still stand—or have been reduced to charred ruins and forgotten myths—remains a mystery.



_A broken city of woven halls, creeping roots, and stolen gods, now fought over by scavengers, zealots, and something worse._

The Tetzilwahi Mounds were once a thriving civilization, their great woven structures grown from sacred plants, shaped by careful cultivation, and honored by their people. Now, they are fractured, caught between rival factions, ancient secrets, and the jungle itself reclaiming what was left behind.

Different locations are contested, hidden, or controlled, shifting as the factions battle over what remains.





### 4. The Mask Grove (Once a Place of Worship, Now a Graveyard)

- What It Was:
    - A sacred grove where new masks were crafted and placed on the plant-mounds.
    - Each mask represented a spirit, ancestor, or god, with deep cultural significance.
- What It Is Now:
    - The masks have fallen from their places, now scattered and buried in the dirt.
    - Some goblins wear them, treating them as trophies or decorations.
    - The fey mock them, painting over the old faces with grotesque smiles.
    - The air is heavy with silence—almost no birds or animals make noise here.

⮕ Potential Story Hook: Lanternhead might find his own family's mask among the ruins, or one that still holds a trace of magic.




## Introduction

The Tetzilwahi Ruins (also known as the Tetzilwahi Mounds) are the remnants of an ancient elven/drow civilization deep in the jungle. Once, enormous vine-covered living mounds served as both homes and temples for the Tetzilwahi people. Now those structures lie overgrown and hollow, haunted by echoes of the past and contested by new inhabitants. This adventure is a sandbox exploration of the ruins, with multiple entry points and paths. There is no linear route—the party can choose how to navigate the ruins, which factions to ally with (if any), and what goals to pursue. The tone blends mystery, danger, and the supernatural: characters will negotiate with desperate survivors, face zealots guided by misinterpreted myths, and encounter an eerie magic that blurs dream and reality.

The heroes arrive at the jungle-shrouded Tetzilwahi Ruins, where three main factions vie for control: the Takers, pragmatic scavengers who see the ruins as loot; the Maskbearers, a cult of warriors and mystics who seek to claim the lost gods’ power; and the Vine-Taken, unfortunate souls absorbed and transformed by the jungle’s creeping magic. Unbeknownst to all, an ancient dream-spirit called Mama Yaya is anchored in these ruins, subtly influencing events through a phenomenon locals call the Hollow – a haze of living dream magic. The characters can explore towering vine-choked halls, flooded chambers, and sacred sites left untouched, uncovering the true history of the Tetzilwahi. They will navigate faction intrigues and tensions, discover hidden secrets (such as the real purpose of the ritual masks and the fate of a lost Tetzilwahi ancestor), and possibly confront or bargain with Mama Yaya herself. By adventure’s end, the party might broker peace between factions, vanquish or outwit the cult, free the jungle from its curse, or escape with ancient treasures (and possibly a curse or two) depending on their choices.


The Tetzilwahi Civilization: Long ago, the Tetzilwahi elves (sometimes called Tetzilwahi drow) built a hidden city in the jungle canopy known as the Tetzilwahi Mounds. These were not ordinary buildings but enormous living structures – giant magical plants grown and shaped over generations into habitable mounds. Each mound was hollowed from within into interwoven chambers supported by thick, rib-like roots. As the mound matured, it could reach hundreds of feet tall, connected by rope bridges and vine pathways high above the forest floor. The Tetzilwahi tended these growths carefully, essentially growing their city from the living jungle. Within the hollow halls, families lived and elders conducted rituals by the light of bioluminescent fungi. Illusion magic was woven into the area to hide the entrances and paths from intruders – the jungle itself seemed to conceal the Tetzilwahi.

Masks and Living Gods: Central to Tetzilwahi spirituality was the belief that each fully-grown mound became a living god, a guardian housing the spirits of their ancestors. The people did not wear masks themselves in daily life; instead, when a mound reached maturity, the tribe’s artisans would craft a grand ritual mask and place it on the face of the mound. These giant masks, fitted onto the living structures, were sacred emblems meant for the mounds-as-gods, not for mortals. They symbolized protection, wisdom, and the presence of the ancestors watching over the people. Major ceremonies – births, funerals, rites of passage – took place in the largest mound-temples under the gaze of these god-masks. The Tetzilwahi elders acted as caretakers and interpreters of each mound’s will (as expressed through subtle signs like growth patterns, fungal glows, and dream-omens). This culture thrived in isolation for ages, its “masked gods” guarding the jungle canopy.

Fall of the Mounds: The outside world eventually shattered this peace. During a period of imperial expansion, Steorrian forces entered the region known as “the Jaw” (the larger jungle expanse). The Tetzilwahi had a reputation as elusive raiders, and conflicts with Steorrian colonists escalated into war. The Steorrians, armed with steel and fire, targeted the great mounds themselves. They saw these towering structures as fortresses and pagan idols. One by one, the sacred mounds were attacked, burned, or felled. The Tetzilwahi fought fiercely from their living towers, but they were outnumbered and facing firearms and organized military tactics. In the end, most of the mounds were left charred and hollow, and the Tetzilwahi society collapsed. Their famed leader – an elf chieftain remembered only by the nickname “Lanternhead” – was captured and carried off in chains, symbolically extinguishing the light of their people. In the aftermath, any survivors fled deep into the jungle or assimilated into other native groups. No one knows if any of the sacred mounds survived intact in hidden corners of the jungle, or if any true Tetzilwahi still live to remember the old ways.

The Ruins Dormant: For decades (or even a century) after the fall, the Tetzilwahi Mounds lay mostly abandoned. The jungle, ever merciful and merciless, grew over the scars of war. Vines and moss reclaimed the burnt halls. Wildlife nested in the empty chambers. To the colonizers, the place was just another _“pacified”_ site, left to rot. But old magic still lingered in these ruins – the echoes of ancestor spirits and the latent enchantments once nurtured by the Tetzilwahi. Deep within the ruined mounds, something waited. Some say the ancestral spirits never left and brooded in silence; others claim that the jungle itself, fed by blood and sorrow, birthed a new consciousness in those halls. Locals in nearby settlements began to speak of strange lights in the abandoned mounds and people vanishing near the site. But for a long time, the ruins remained mostly undisturbed by civilization, shunned as a haunted, cursed place.

Mama Yaya Awakened:  In a hidden, flooded chamber of the ruins, Oraya II’s attempt to commune with the ancestors instead caught the attention of Yaya, a mysterious fey-like entity. Yaya was a remnant spirit from a long-sealed faerie wellspring (the Fountain of Blood, as Jaw legends call it) – essentially an immortal dream-hag that had been lingering, formless, in the deep jungle. Sensing an opportunity, Yaya anchored herself to Oraya II, invading her mind and body. Oraya II was overwhelmed by visions and ultimately possessed by this being. Thus “Mama Yaya” entered the mortal realm in physical form, wearing Oraya II’s body like a shell. Among Oraya’s native allies, this possession may have been mistaken for a divine epiphany – they took to calling the transformed woman “Mama Yaya thinking some jungle spirit (perhaps an ancestor or goddess) now spoke through her. Indeed, Yaya presented herself as a wise, otherworldly “Grandmother” figure.

However, the Selvean war effort never truly benefited from Oraya’s actions. Perhaps Yaya had no interest in the war, or Oraya’s followers were driven off or killed in the crossfire. Ultimately, Steorr and Selvea’s war moved on and the Jaw remained contested, but the Tetzilwahi ruins were left with a new resident: Mama Yaya and her subtle Hollow.

The Hollow: After bonding with Oraya II, Mama Yaya created a domain within the ruins, a blurred overlap of dream and reality known as the Hollow. The very air in parts of the ruins carries a dreamy, soporific quality – visitors experience deja vu, lost time, or hallucinations of the past. Vines bloom with bioluminescent flowers that whisper or release spores causing drowsiness. Pools of water might reflect scenes from long ago instead of one’s face. This effect is strongest near Yaya’s personal lair (a sunken section of the ruins she claims), but it seeps throughout the complex. Over decades, the Hollow has turned the ruins into a place where memories linger tangibly and unwary trespassers can lose themselves (both figuratively and literally). Some who came seeking fortune instead wandered in circles, trapped in illusions until the jungle claimed them. These poor souls became the eerie Vine-Taken, changed by the corrupted Green Veil’s magic (see factions below).

Current Inhabitants: In the present day, the Tetzilwahi Ruins are far from empty. Word of sheltered ruins and mystical bounty drew in scavengers, while whispers of lingering “jungle gods” drew in occult seekers. Several distinct groups now inhabit and war over the mounds:



Meanwhile, Mama Yaya remains an elusive puppeteer. She is not aligned with any faction, though the Maskbearers’ fervor has likely been stoked by cryptic dreams she sends. Yaya’s goal is not conquest of the ruins but the perpetuation of her story and influence. She ensures no one faction ever fully wins – a deadly balance of power is maintained. The result is an ever-shifting dungeon: no one controls it all, and today’s ally might be tomorrow’s enemy. The original Tetzilwahi secrets remain buried in the chaos.

Adventure Tone and Themes: Exploring the Tetzilwahi Ruins should feel like delving into a lost world where history itself haunts the party. The players will encounter cultural mysteries (Why are there masks on these structures? What happened to the people here?), faction intrigue (dealing with desperate scavengers vs. radical cultists), and supernatural horror (the creeping vines and oneiric traps of the Hollow). There are opportunities for combat, certainly, but also diplomacy (you can talk to the Takers, possibly even the Maskbearers under the right guise) and investigation (clues scattered in carvings, objects, and ghostly encounters). The dungeon’s design allows players to tackle challenges in various orders – they might skip some areas, or retreat and find another way around an obstacle.

## Adventure Hooks

Use one or more of these hooks to motivate the party to explore the Tetzilwahi Ruins. Each hook presents a different angle (greed, altruism, personal tie, etc.), and you can adapt them as needed for your campaign:

- Legacy of the Masked Gods: A party member (or a patron who hires them) is a descendant of the Tetzilwahi or a scholar of their culture. Old stories or family lore hint that something of their people endures in the ruins – perhaps an ancestral mask or heirloom lies there, or restless ancestral spirits call out for peace. This hook makes the exploration deeply personal. A character of Tetzilwahi heritage might experience vivid dreams drawing them to the mounds. Upon entering the ruins, they could even find their name or family name carved somewhere, or a Maskbearer might recognize features of “Lanternhead’s line” in them. This hook can lead to roleplaying moments where the ancestral memory of the place resonates strongly (for better or worse) with the character.
    
- Treasure in the Jungle: Rumors circulate of valuable relics and magical plants in the Tetzilwahi Mounds. Collectors in the city of Harboursjaw will pay handsomely for authentic elf-crafted masks or for samples of the spores said to induce prophetic visions. The party is hired by a treasure-hunting guild, scholarly college, or criminal syndicate to venture in and retrieve specific items – for example: _“Bring back one of the great god-masks”_ or _“Procure a vial of that dream-inducing fungus.”_ Greed and curiosity drive this hook. It positions the dungeon as a lucrative but deadly expedition. (Unbeknownst to the players, many who sought these riches became Vine-Taken or were slain by factions, so their competition may be the very fates of past treasure-hunters!)
    
- Rescue Mission: A few weeks ago, a small group of outsiders wandered into the ruins and didn’t return. They might be researchers (a missing scholar who went to study the Maskbearers’ rites), missionaries (foolish clerics trying to convert the Maskbearers or bring them “civilized” religion), or even local children who chased a pet into the jungle and vanished. The party is implored by a village elder or a guild to find and rescue the missing people. This hook casts the characters as saviors entering a dangerous unknown. In the ruins, they might discover the missing individuals have been captured (perhaps held for sacrifice by Maskbearers, or forced to fight in a goblin pit by Takers). Alternatively, the victims may have succumbed to the Hollow – possibly now among the Vine-Taken. The rescue attempt can turn into a moral dilemma if those they seek are no longer fully themselves.
    
- Silence the Zealots: The rise of the Maskbearer cult has not gone unnoticed. Nearby settlements and colonial authorities have heard reports of raiders wearing bizarre masks attacking caravans or kidnapping travelers near the jungle edge. The Maskbearers might be gathering sacrifices or seeking components for rituals. In any case, the party (perhaps contracted by a governor, or motivated by a personal encounter with the cult’s brutality) is tasked to infiltrate the ruins and eliminate or disrupt the Maskbearers. They might be given intel about multiple entry points or known cult habits. This hook sets the Maskbearers as the primary antagonists – the party will likely end up allying with or at least negotiating with the Takers, since “the enemy of my enemy” can be useful. However, as the party learns more of the cult’s beliefs and the true history, they may find simply killing them doesn’t resolve the deeper issue of the ruins’ curse.
    
- Creeping Curse: In the past month, villagers or hunters living on the outskirts of the Jaw have experienced strange dreams, sleepwalking, and even unexplained vines growing overnight on their huts. A wise hermit suspects this is due to the awakening of the “Hollow” in the old Tetzilwahi site – an unchecked magic that could spread. The party is enlisted to investigate the source of these uncanny events. This hook leads the players in as essentially exorcists or curse-breakers. Their goal might be to find whatever is causing the dream-magic (likely Mama Yaya’s influence) and put an end to it. This hook guarantees confrontation with Yaya or at least requires the party to understand her role. They might need to recover a specific item like _the “Lantern of Dreams”_ or perform a counter-ritual with instructions from the hermit. It’s a good hook if you want the focus to be on solving the supernatural mystery and possibly redeeming the land (rather than looting).
    
- War Legacy: A veteran from the Steorrian–Selvean war seeks closure. Perhaps an old Selvean soldier who fought alongside Oraya II knows she disappeared near the mounds, and now as an aging man he hires the party to find out what became of “Mama Yaya” and her followers. Or a Steorrian officer wants any leftover “weapons” the natives were crafting in that jungle (they might not know what exactly – perhaps thinking there’s a hidden cache of magic or even a dormant weapon left by Oraya’s rebellion). This hook ties directly into the historical events: the party might carry old documents or journals that point to secret tunnels. They’ll delve into the ruins following the footprints of Oraya II’s warband, possibly uncovering her fate. This can reveal the backstory with Mama Yaya more explicitly as part of the mission. It works well if you want to integrate the ruins into the larger political history of your world.
    

Feel free to combine hooks or add complications (for example, the party could start on a treasure hunt but then encounter a desperate NPC begging them for help against the cult, thus introducing a rescue element). Once the characters have reasons to be at the ruins’ outskirts, proceed to Approaching the Ruins.

## Approaching the Ruins (Multiple Entrances)

The Tetzilwahi Ruins sprawl across a dense jungle basin. There is no single gate or front door – over time, various breaches and pathways have opened. Each major entrance is watched or utilized by a different faction. The party can choose how to approach, and their choice will determine the first challenges they face (and which faction they meet first). They might scout ahead and pick an entry, or they could stumble into whoever is closest. Below are three primary ways in:

|Entrance & Path|Controlled By|Description & Challenges|
||||
|1. Overgrown Approach (Main Trail)|Takers’ Outposts (Scavengers)|A wide, overgrown roadway once used by the Tetzilwahi and later by Steorrians. Now, crude barricades and watchtowers of lashed wood mark the Takers’ territory. Goblin sentries and human bandit lookouts perch in the treetops and shattered walls. If the party approaches openly, they’ll be stopped by armed scavengers. They can attempt to parley (the Takers might let “traders” in for a toll or bribe), sneak through the foliage (Stealth DC ~15 to slip past sentries), or fight their way in. Clues like old Steorrian rusted weapons and a scorched totem mask half-buried in mud litter the path. This entrance is the most obvious and thus heavily watched, but also the most straightforward in terms of navigation (it leads into the Outer Mounds area).|
|2. Sunken Cave (Water Gate)|Vine-Taken (no intelligent guards, but infested)|Off to one side of the ruins, a stream disappears under a tangle of roots and fallen stone. This semi-submerged tunnel was an escape route or drainage channel that collapsed and became a waterway. It leads directly into the flooded lower halls (the Waterlogged Depths). The Takers avoid it (too dangerous) and the Maskbearers don’t swim, so only the Vine-Taken roam here. Entering this way requires wading or swimming in chest-deep water through darkness. Characters will need light and might contend with hazards like slippery rocks or sudden drop-offs (Athletics or Acrobatics checks to navigate). Encounters: The party could be ambushed in the water by a vine blight or drowned undead (remnants of a past explorer). The upside is that this entrance bypasses the outer guards; the downside is the party comes face-to-face with the dungeon’s horrors early, and they may emerge in the middle of Vine-Taken territory, disoriented.|
|3. Canopy Bridge (Hidden High Path)|Maskbearer Cult (patrols)|The most secret approach is via the treetops. The Tetzilwahi built rope bridges high in the canopy; one rotten bridge still spans from a cliff side to an upper terrace of a large mound. The Maskbearers, who prize the old ways, have repaired portions of these high routes to move in and out unseen. Discovering this route might require scouting (Perception DC 15 to spot old ropes or markings up in the trees). Climbing up is tricky (Climb DC 12 with vines and branches available). If the party uses this entrance, they effectively drop into the middle level of the ruins. Likely encounter: a Maskbearer scout or lookout on the bridge – perhaps a lone cultist wearing a crude mask, performing a quiet chant. The party could ambush this guard or attempt to pose as fellow cultists (not easy without prior knowledge or a mask). The bridge itself could be trapped or unstable; a failed Stealth might cause a shout and a skirmish on precarious planks 40 feet above ground. Entering here positions the party near the Hollow Paths (the cult’s main zone) right away.|


Once the party breaches the perimeter, they will find themselves in the Outer Mounds region, or if they took the high path, possibly directly in the Hollow Paths. The next sections detail the regions of the dungeon, the factions’ presence in each, locations, and encounter ideas.

## Factions of the Ruins

The three primary factions in the ruins are the Takers, Maskbearers, and (the) Vine-Taken. Each controls different areas and has distinct goals and methods. None of them are monolithic or omniscient – smart players can play them against each other or exploit their weaknesses. In addition, the secretive presence of Mama Yaya underpins many events, though she has no army of her own. Below is a summary of each faction and key NPCs.

## Faction Tensions and Dynamics

The ruins are a three-way battleground (with a secret fourth player in Yaya). The factions clash in a slow, ongoing war of attrition. Here is a summary of their tensions:

- Takers vs. Maskbearers: These two are in open conflict. The Takers see the cultists as dangerous fanatics interfering with business, while the Maskbearers see the Takers as heretical looters defiling holy ground. Skirmishes happen frequently: e.g. a band of Maskbearers might launch a nighttime raid on a Taker supply cache, or Taker crossbowmen might ambush a lone Maskbearer scouting party. Neither side has the numbers for full assault, resulting in a tense stalemate. If the PCs ally with one, expect the other to become hostile. They will not negotiate with each other unless perhaps the party brokers an extremely compelling temporary truce (like convincing both to cease fighting to deal with a greater threat such as Yaya or a massive Vine-Taken outbreak).
    
- Takers vs. Vine-Taken: The Takers do not “war” with the Vine-Taken like they do with the cult, but any encounter is deadly. Takers patrols sometimes vanish in the deeper halls, and the rest find only strangled, vine-covered corpses later. Thus, the Takers generally mark certain flooded sections as no-go zones. They’ve even been known to collapse passages to keep Vine-Taken from wandering out. When confrontation happens, Takers use fire and numbers to hack down the creatures. They view the Vine-Taken almost like a natural hazard (akin to quicksand or venomous snakes): fight if you must, but better to avoid. This means large parts of the inner ruins are effectively uncontrolled because the Takers fear to push too far in.
    
- Maskbearers vs. Vine-Taken: The Maskbearers, believing in the sanctity of the site, initially saw the Vine-Taken as _“part of the jungle’s trials.”_ Low-ranking cultists dread these encounters, whispering that the victims were “claimed by the gods for their weakness.” High-ranking members sometimes deliberately seek out Vine-Taken in hopes of gleaning insight or proving their dominance over the jungle. In one known incident, Zalra Three-Faces led a purge into the Waterlogged Depths and destroyed several Vine-Taken, declaring it a holy cleansing. However, the cult suffered losses too and learned respect for this threat. Now, Maskbearers only venture into Vine-Taken territory when they believe a great reward or secret is there (for example, they suspect a lost Tetzilwahi shrine lies beyond a Vine-Taken-filled corridor, so they muster strength to push through). Encounters are vicious – the cult uses radiant or fire magic if they have it, and they always retrieve their fallen (burning the bodies) to prevent “the shame” of becoming Vine-Taken. They do not realize the connection between the Vine-Taken and Mama Yaya’s magic; they frame it purely as a spiritual curse or blessing of the land.
    
- Influence of Mama Yaya: None of the factions truly realize they are being manipulated by a hidden force. Yaya’s interventions (like sending dreams or luring someone to their doom) are seen as either divine omens or just misfortune. For example, if Father Haon receives a dream telling him to halt an attack, he assumes it’s the gods’ will (Yaya ensuring balance). If Scorchfang suddenly falls asleep at his post and misses a chance to stab Haon, he curses the “jungle fever” (Yaya’s doing as well). Thus, there’s an uneasy equilibrium: whenever one faction seems poised to gain the upper hand, something inexplicable happens to check them. The net effect is that the status quo of conflict persists, which is exactly what Yaya wants. The factions would likely unite in terror if they knew an immortal hag was pulling strings – but revealing that to them would be a challenge the party might undertake.
    

Using Tensions in Play: The faction tensions create opportunities for the PCs:

- They might broker a deal with one faction to get assistance against another (e.g. trade some Green Veil fungus to the Takers in exchange for a guide; promise to help the cult retrieve a relic in exchange for safe passage).
    
- They could spark a faction war to cover their own actions – for instance, secretly causing a Maskbearer idol to be stolen and planting evidence blaming the Takers, igniting a skirmish while the party sneaks deeper in.
    
- Conversely, they might attempt to pacify one faction to reduce overall danger (e.g. convince a young Maskbearer acolyte that Father Haon is leading them astray, sowing dissent).
    
- Keep in mind: any alliance is fraught with betrayal. A Taker boss might betray the party if a better profit appears. A Maskbearer might decide the party themselves are blasphemers once they’ve outlived usefulness. Use the faction relations to create a dynamic, living dungeon where the situation can evolve based on the party’s choices.
    

Next, we’ll explore the major regions of the ruins and specific locations within them, along with encounter ideas and secrets that characters can discover.

## Secrets and Clues Summary

Throughout the adventure, the party can uncover many secrets that reveal the history and hidden truths of Tetzilwahi. Here is a summary of the key revelations and how they might be learned:

- True Purpose of the Masks: _The Tetzilwahi made ritual masks to place on their sacred mounds (their living gods), not to wear themselves._ This can be deduced from mural carvings (showing unmasked people venerating a masked tree), inscriptions in the Overlook tower, and the general absence of any depiction of people wearing the masks. The Maskbearers’ core belief is thus a misinterpretation. PCs who realize this can understand that the cult’s attempts to gain power are fundamentally flawed – the masks were symbolic offerings, not sources of power by themselves.
    
- The Failed Sacrifice: _In the final days of the Tetzilwahi, the priests performed a grand sacrifice/ritual to call upon their gods to save them from invaders – but nothing happened._ This left the survivors heartbroken and led to them abandoning the site. Evidence: the scratched inscription in the Hollow Library (_“The sacrifice was false. The god was silent. But we left the mask behind.”_), and perhaps ghosts or visions reliving that moment. This secret gives context that the “gods” (i.e., the ancestor spirits or whatever powers the mounds had) either couldn’t or wouldn’t intervene. It also implies that the Last Mask on the altar was part of that abandoned plea.
    
- Lanternhead’s Legacy: _Lanternhead (t) was captured, but his bloodline continued in secret through Oraya I and beyond._ The players might find references to Lanternhead’s family in the Overlook memorial or the Last Offering altar (names inscribed). They might also find Oraya II’s journal that mentions her son Rilith. From these, they can piece together that a descendant still lives (Oraya III, aka Mo). Even if Mo isn’t physically present, the party could later seek her out or at least leave the site with knowledge that the Tetzilwahi line survives. If a PC is that descendant, these clues confirm their heritage and can be very emotionally significant (e.g. discovering their great-grandmother Oraya II’s writings and realizing the “witch of the jungle” was actually their kin trying to save their culture).
    
- Mama Yaya’s Identity: _the so-called jungle spirit, is actually an otherworldly hag  who possessed Oraya II’s body during the war._ Clues include Oraya II’s journal in the Drowned Archives (silver-haired crone appearing in dreams), the Selvean carvings (perhaps even a phrase like “Yaya promises what the gods did not”), and direct interaction with Yaya where she might slip and refer to Oraya’s memories or speak with a dual voice. Once the party realizes the kindly “Mama Yaya” revered by the cult is _the same being_ as the malicious dream-hag, they understand the source of the Hollow and can target the true villain rather than attributing it to “angry gods.” This secret, when revealed to Maskbearers (if they would even believe it), utterly shatters their doctrine – their “divine guide” is actually a parasite on their people’s legacy.
    

        
- Fate of the Vine-Taken: _The plant-zombies are what becomes of those lost in dream and magic – effectively a fate that could befall anyone who stays in the Hollow too long._ Subtle clues: Vine-Taken whisper fragments of personal memories, some wear remnants of various clothing (not all one tribe – implying anyone can become one). Perhaps a journal on a dead adventurer outside might have an entry “Day 4: I can’t tell what’s real, the vines…they’re so beautiful…” ending abruptly. The secret for players is that there’s likely no saving someone once fully Vine-Taken (short of high-level magic). However, if Yaya is banished, newly taken individuals might recover if not too far gone. This informs the players’ choices when dealing with say a captured friend or any thought of “curing” the cultists by force – the real cure is ending the source (Yaya’s magic).
    
- Hidden Escape Tunnel: _The Tetzilwahi considered or attempted an escape route (the Sealed Stairwell), but didn’t finish it._ Not a huge lore secret, but it explains some skeletons and also ironically is where the players emerged (if they came from below). It’s a cautionary tale: even their escape plan failed due to time. “We should have waited” might refer to wishing they’d stayed to finish it or to get a sign from their gods – it’s ambiguous.
    
- Ancestral Spirits vs. Yaya: _The ancestral spirits are weak or departed, but in the heart of the sanctuary they still linger enough to oppose Yaya._ The players might not get this as a spelled-out fact, but they can intuit it when, for example, Yaya’s powers falter in the Last Offering hall, or if they feel a sense of comfort there. The secret implication is that the true power of the place was always the people’s unity and remembrance – once they left, that power waned, allowing something like Yaya to fill the void. It’s a thematic secret rather than a factual one: perhaps the “gods” of the mounds were only ever as strong as the community that believed in them. This could inspire a player of that lineage to consider trying to rekindle that tradition properly in the future.
    

Revealing these secrets to the players piece by piece will help them understand the full narrative by the climax. They may choose to share some secrets with factions (e.g., telling a surviving Maskbearer the truth of Mama Yaya to break their fanaticism, or informing the Takers that the real danger was not ghosts but the hag – though Takers might just shrug and say “witch or ghost, it’s all trouble”). Other secrets they may keep to themselves or take back to a sage or community outside.

## Adventure Conclusion and Aftermath

How the adventure ends will depend on the party’s actions and which goals they prioritized. Here are a few likely outcomes and ways to wrap up the story in a satisfying way:

- Restoring Balance: If the party managed to broker peace or at least eliminate the immediate threats, the Tetzilwahi Ruins might enter a more peaceful chapter. With Yaya’s Hollow dispelled and the factions leaderless or subdued, the jungle’s natural state returns. Perhaps over the next days, the eerie whispers cease and for the first time in ages, birds and normal wildlife return to nest in the mounds (a sign that the curse is lifted). The players leave knowing they have laid vengeful spirits to rest and stopped a cycle of violence. In a bittersweet sense, the ruins might finally become a true grave for the past – quiet and respected, rather than a battleground.

- Faction Victors: The party might have allied with one faction to wipe out the other. In the short term, that faction takes control. For example, if they helped the Takers drive off the cult, the Takers will loot even deeper – possibly uncovering more than they bargained for. The party might get a share of treasure and a reputation as formidable mercenaries. However, the long-term consequences could be complex: perhaps with Yaya weakened, the Takers become less cruel (some might even leave, spooked by what they saw), or conversely they might start squabbling over spoils once the common enemy is gone. The party could negotiate terms like urging the Takers to leave certain areas (like the Last Offering) untouched as part of their reward. Similarly, if the cult somehow “won” with the party’s help, they might descend into internal conflict (maybe some realize the truth of Mama Yaya and splinter into a more benign sect). In any case, the party should walk away with tangible rewards (gold, artifacts, maybe a promise of aid from that faction in the future) but also the knowledge that power vacuums can be dangerous.






### Environmental Themes
- Dream contamination: Visions and emotional echoes cling to certain sites
- Vertical exploration: Canopy platforms, hanging bridges, and root tunnels
- Illusions and memory traps: Especially strong near old ritual spaces
