- Hall of Unworn Masks: A sacred vault where hand-crafted masks await connection to worthy souls. The air whispers with potential.
- Makers’ Hollow: A forge-temple within a partially living mound where masks are crafted from bark, bone, and volcanic glass. Blindfolded artisans sing to guide the shaping.
- The Ascendant Walk: A spiraling treetop path that leads to the last standing Tetzilwahi masks still embedded in trees. Pilgrims whisper prayers and leave offerings.
- Gate of Painted Roots: Their masked-only entrance. A tunnel through vine-wrapped roots dyed in ritual colors. Initiates must crawl through to “emerge reborn.”


**Theme**: Flawed reverence, ritual artistry, reconstructed divinity  
**Tone**: Quiet, charged with meaning—an illusion of ancient sacredness built on devotion and error



### Hall of Unworn Masks

- The central vault of sacred masks, handcrafted by Maskbearers and awaiting their destined wearers.
- Whispering echoes of claimed or abandoned identities drift through the space.
- Revered as a place of potential and purpose.
    



### The Makers’ Hollow _(Maskcrafting Forge-Temple)_

- A tiered workshop carved into the heart of a living mound.
- Here, masks are chiseled from bone, lacquered bark, volcanic glass, and stone; woven with cord and vine; dyed with ash and blood.
- Each Maskbearer apprentice creates a mask as a rite of passage, inscribing symbols they only half-understand.
- Artisans wear blindfolds during carving, believing the mask reveals its own shape.\n- Echoes of the original Tetzilwahi maskcraft survive here—but distorted.




### The Ascendant Walk _(Ritual Pilgrimage Path)_

- A suspended lattice of bridges and platforms spiraling through the canopy.
- Leads to the last standing Tetzilwahi giant masks still embedded in the living trees.
- Pilgrims leave offerings, chant names, and whisper their own fears or questions.
- Some believe the masks answer—through dreams, coincidences, or falling leaves.

## The Gate of Painted Roots _(Maskbearer Entrance)_

- A winding arch formed by tree roots painted with ritual dyes—red ochre, white chalk, blue spores.
- Initiates crawl through a short tunnel beneath it in a rite called the “First Descent.”
- The entrance is semi-hidden and shifts slightly with seasons; only those wearing a mask (real or symbolic) can find it.
- Symbolizes shedding the mundane self to “emerge” into truth.
