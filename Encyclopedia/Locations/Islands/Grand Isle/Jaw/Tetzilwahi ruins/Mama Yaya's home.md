Mama Yaya’s home is hidden within the fallen, oversized mask of the Drowsy One, but it is shielded from casual view by a potent illusion and spatial magic.
The Phantasmal Veil & Threshold
The mouth of the mask appears to be choked with a dense, impassable thicket of thorny roots and fleshy, dark leaves. From the outside, it looks like nothing more than a dead end. This barrier, however, is a phantasmal illusion. It can be circumvented not with force, but by recognizing its unreal nature and simply walking through it as if it were mist.
Passing the threshold is a disorienting experience. The air instantly becomes heavy and still, thick with the smell of rich, loamy earth, decaying leaves, and the faint, metallic tinge of blood. All sound from the outside world is completely silenced, replaced by a profound quiet that presses in from all sides.
Inside the Mask: A Home Beyond Space
The interior is a vast, circular grotto, impossibly larger than the mask's exterior would suggest. The curved walls are made of a smooth, reddish clay, interwoven with a living network of deep green vines and dark, fibrous roots that pulse with a slow, faint light. The entire space feels ancient and organic, a fusion of artistry and nature.
 * The Hearth of Unburning Flame: In the center of the chamber, a fire pit carved into the clay floor holds ethereal, silvery flames. They provide a soft, steady light and a comforting warmth but produce no smoke and do not consume the dried, crimson-hued leaves arranged within.
 * The Scrying Basin: Against one wall rests a large, tub-like basin sculpted from the same clay, its rim marked with spiraling patterns. It is filled with a dark, still liquid that reflects nothing, serving as her pool for scrying into memories and dreams.
 * A Living Loom: Seated on a low stool woven from reeds is Mama Yaya. In her lap, she methodically weaves shimmering, silver vines, her unnaturally long fingers moving with hypnotic deliberation. The blood flowers in her hair give off a deep crimson glow in the firelight, and the faint, rhythmic thrum of her heartbeat fills the oppressive silence of the chamber. She does not look up, yet she is aware of everything, a quiet, ancient power at the center of her impossible home.
