- Shattercamp Bazaar: The scavenger capital—built within a collapsed mound and surrounded by jury-rigged fences and trophy poles. Contains a black market and fighting pits.
- The Black Nests: Treetop outposts and sniper nests used for lookout, ambush, and dumping trash. Connected by ropes and zip lines.
- Choketooth Gate: The main Bonepicker entrance, marked by bone totems, burnt icons, and urinated effigies. Guarded by goblin brawlers.
- The Gut Channels: Underground tunnels and root-hollowed smuggler paths. Useful for stealth and ambush, but unstable and prone to collapse.



#### 1A. The Overgrown Approach (Main Entry, Guarded)

- Scorchfang patrols watch from treetop nests.
- Survival (DC 14) to find an unguarded path.
- Stealth (DC 15) to move past unseen.
- Failure = Combat (Bandit Captain + 2 Scouts).

#### 1B. The Taker’s Market (Scavenger Trading Post, Neutral Ground)

- A merchant offers a map—but "It’s missing pieces."
- Insight (DC 13) to realize a trader is lying about an artifact’s origin.
- A smuggler can get the party inside—but only if they steal something first.

#### 1C. The Bone-Ringed Hall (Scorchfang War Camp, Recently Attacked)

- A burned god-mask lies shattered, marked with ritual scars.
- Investigation (DC 14) reveals tracks leading to a collapsed passage.


1. **Shattercamp Bazaar** _(base + market)_
    
    - Built in the shell of a broken mound whose inner roots now serve as stalls and dens
    
    - Cages hang from the ceiling, some holding creatures, some masks
    
    - Vendors sell “blessed junk,” bone charms, mask fragments, and stolen relics
    
    - Loud, dangerous, and sometimes welcoming—depending on what you’re carrying

2. **The Black Nests** _(lookout & ambush network)_
    
    - Suspended treetop stations, accessible only by rope and zipline
    
    - Act as patrol points, sniper perches, and early warning systems
    
    - Some nests are hollowed out for sleeping or stashing loot
    
    - Occasionally drop “gifts” or detritus onto passing enemies
    
3. **Choketooth Gate** _(Scavenger entrance)_
    
    - Entry zone marked by sharpened wood, charred vines, and skull totems
        
    - Named for a scavenger whose jawbone is nailed above the gate
        
    - Guarded by talkative and trigger-happy goblins; tolls are negotiable
        
    - A burned effigy of an old Tetzilwahi ancestor stands nearby, often urinated on
        
4. **The Gut Channels** _(navigation tunnels)_
    
    - A series of collapsed tunnels beneath a mound, now used as stealthy travel routes
        
    - Smugglers, cutthroats, and bonepickers move supplies or prey through here
        
    - Rotted roots make for unstable footing; some routes flood unpredictably
