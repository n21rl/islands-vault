### **1. Grand Mound**

The spiritual heart of the ruins—once crowned by the god-mask, now cracked and overgrown.  
Contested by all factions:

- **Maskbearers** seek to reclaim and purify it.
    
- **Takers** dig into its root-chambers for relics.
    
- **Vine-Taken** are drawn to its core and linger like guardians.
    

**Special features:**

- **Dream-storms** are strongest here—players may experience time-lost visions or memory echoes.
    
- The **fallen mask** conceals the **hidden passage to Mama Yaya’s lair**.
    
- Whispers echo when players speak their own names aloud.

### **2. Shattercamp Bazaar**

A ramshackle, scavenger-controlled market inside a collapsed outer mound.  
Run by Takers and goblin traders dealing in:

- Salvaged masks, sacred wood, spore-drafts, and counterfeit relics.
    
- Stolen pages from Oraya’s journals, used masks with altered stories.
    

**Atmosphere:**

- Loud, tense, mistrustful.
    
- Factional agents spy on one another.
    
- Locals speak of Mama Yaya like she’s a storm—unseen but close.
    

**Leads to:** clues about the **Hall of Unworn Masks**, fungal routes to **Gravebloom Hollow**, and shortcut items tied to **the Gate of Painted Roots**.

### **3. Hall of Unworn Masks**

An ancient chamber of masks that were **never donned**—whether rejected, cursed, or still waiting.  
Used by Maskbearers for:

- **Sorting, penance, and exorcism** rituals.
    
- Occasional dream trials—some initiates never return.
    

**Interactive elements:**

- Masks may **whisper, project memories**, or weep fungus.
    
- Oraya’s note refers to it as a _“gallery of should-have-beens.”_
    

**Connections:**

- Mask inscriptions reference the **Makers’ Hollow**.
    
- Some masks show designs matching **Vine-Taken** seen in **Gravebloom**.
    

---

### **4. Makers’ Hollow**

A secret forge-labyrinth where masks are carved with **song, touch, and sap**.  
Artisans here are **blindfolded**, believing sight would corrupt the face of memory.

**Tensions:**

- Traditional mask-crafters vs. new-age artisans experimenting with **Vine-Taken bio-growth**.
    
- Echoes of Oraya’s early observations linger in carvings.
    

**Clues point toward:**

- **Gravebloom Hollow** as a source of organic materials.
    
- **Grand Mound** as the sacred site where completed masks were “returned.”

### **5. Gravebloom Hollow**

A once-sacred burial site now twisted by the Hollow Drowse.  
Vines grow through old graves, sprouting fungal lanterns and memory-altering spores.

**Inhabitants:**

- **Vine-Taken** drift here in eerie half-awareness.
    
- Some seem to respond to player names or masks they've worn.
    

**Oraya’s reflection:**

> _“They do not rot. They remember.”_

**Navigational notes:**

- Fungal trails here lead toward **Shattercamp** (through trade).
    
- Vine growth patterns mirror carvings in the **Grotto of Still Faces**.
    

---

### **6. Grotto of Still Faces**

A cold, quiet shrine where faces—some masks, some carved flesh—are embedded in the walls.  
Used for **mourning, isolation, or memory storage**.

**Features:**

- The faces **do not speak**, but some **blink or weep silently**.
    
- Presence alone may trigger memory fragments, especially if players carry Oraya’s items.
    

**Function:**

- Connects thematically and symbolically to:
    
    - **Gravebloom** (what becomes of memory)
        
    - **Gate of Painted Roots** (ritual passage beyond the known self)
        

---

### **7. Gate of Painted Roots**

A crawlspace of **red-veined roots** that tests identity.  
Used in Maskbearer initiation rites and spiritual rebirth.

**Mechanics:**

- Crawling through requires sacrifice: a **name, a mask, a memory**.
    
- Success leads to **Mama Yaya’s lair**, hidden beyond.
    

**Echoes:**

- Oraya’s later notes suggest this is the **threshold where she ceased being only Oraya**.

Would you like an additional “summary map” of faction presence and movement across these sites, or should we flesh out what happens _inside_ Mama Yaya’s lair next?
