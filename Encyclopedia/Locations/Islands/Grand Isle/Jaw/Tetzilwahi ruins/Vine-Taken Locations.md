**Theme**: Overgrowth, parasitism, identity loss through plant-hybridization  
**Tone**: Rotting reverence, crawling quiet, body-horror botany
WATERLOGGED area 
The Vine-Taken control these ruins without controlling them
 A group stands motionless

### 1. **The Miregate** _(Threshold of the Rotting Path)_
- A drooping wall of vines, thorn-laced and wet with sap.
- Opens only when undisturbed or when approached by one already seeded.
- Sounds are muted; speech echoes strangely.
- Getting through by force causes the vines to lash and seed the intruder with spores (Con save or gain a Vine Mark infection—cosmetic at first…).

### 2. **Gravebloom Hollow** _(Overtaken Ancestor Field & Rebirth Garden)_
- Was once a high-caste Tetzilwahi burial terrace—now overrun with creeping vines and thorn-choked husks.
- Root-tangles split the earth where honoured dead once lay; blossoms bloom from skulls and rib cages.
- Corpses grow into plants; plants mimic corpses.
- Some husks twitch. Some whisper. Some walk.
- Captured prey is brought here to gestate slowly into Vine-Taken.
- Occasional “memorial” ceremonies are performed by Vine-Taken that mock ancestral rites in broken fragments.

### 3. **The Mire-Hearken Spires** _(Observation Post & Tendril Intelligence)_
- Towering tree-trunks wrapped in thick vine spirals—like antennae.
- The Vine-Taken climb these slowly, curling into still poses for hours to “listen” to the jungle.
- The network of vines here acts like a nervous system. Injuring one tendril might alert others miles away.
- Explorers resting near this area often hear their names in the leaves.
- A possible place to study or intercept the Vine-Taken’s spread—but entering draws immediate attention.


### 4. **The Grotto of Still Faces** _(Sanctuary & Silence Chamber)_
- A sunken glade, half-flooded, with stone effigies that have fused with vine and lichen.
- These faces once represented Tetzilwahi ancestors, now worn blank.
- The Vine-Taken treat this place with reverence and rarely attack here.
- Visitors who remain silent for long enough begin to “hear” the stillness—an invasive presence brushing the edges of thought.
- Some believe the first Vine-Taken emerged here. Some say Cotchia left a seed behind.
