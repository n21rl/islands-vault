Ferngate is a small settlement located on the southern edge of the jungle in the Jaw, near the boundary between former Steorrian territory and Selvean-administered land. Once a minor border town during the Steorrian occupation of the region, it served as a waypoint for caravans, pilgrims, and patrols heading north into the forested interior. Though the town has largely fallen into disrepair, the chapel at its heart—known as the Chapel of the Last Vigil—remains intact and continues to be tended by a lone religious figure.

History

During the later decades of Steorrian rule in the Jaw, Ferngate functioned as a fortified outpost and a religious retreat. It was constructed near a natural clearing where ferns grew in abundance, giving the town its name. The town’s strategic location made it a valuable checkpoint on the road to several jungle-bound settlements and extraction sites. After the Harboursjaw Treaty and the withdrawal of Steorrian forces, most residents abandoned the town, leaving behind overgrown streets, collapsed rooftops, and moss-covered shrines.

Religion and the Chapel

Ferngate’s most enduring feature is its chapel, one of the last functioning sites of the [[Church of the Unwavering Star]] in the region. The chapel is currently maintained by [[Sister Mildort]], a halfling cleric of advanced age who devotes herself to the preservation of faith and the garden she cultivates behind the sanctuary. She offers blessings and simple hospitality to travelers regardless of origin, though her continued presence has drawn suspicion from Selvean authorities.

Selvean Military Presence

Though not formally garrisoned, Ferngate is under observation by a detachment of [[Champions]], led by [[Kavatl]], a Spirit Path officer whose true allegiance lies with the [[Shadow Legion]]. Kavatl has used recent unrest to justify patrols, interrogations, and increased surveillance of the chapel and surrounding hamlets. Several disappearances and arrests have occurred in recent weeks, officially attributed to rebel activity.

Strategic Importance

While no longer a hub of travel, Ferngate remains a point of contention due to its position on the threshold between settled land and deep jungle. Any convoy heading north must pass nearby, making the settlement a natural place for checkpointing and quiet suppression. The growing presence of Champions in the area reflects wider Selvean efforts to contain what they perceive as Steorrian resurgence.

Current Status

Ferngate is not officially abandoned, but it is sparsely inhabited and its authority disputed. While the [[Concord]] no longer claims control, many Steorrians still regard the chapel as holy ground. Its fate may depend on how tensions in the Jaw continue to escalate.

The jungle-edge settlement is a former Steorrian border town with a still-standing church, now watched over by an elderly religious figure named Sister Mildort, a halfling who tends the church and gardens. The settlement is named Ferngate. The Selvean Champion present is named Kaval, and he is secretly a member of the Shadow Legion, stirring trouble and blaming Steorrians to justify repression.
