Situated at the mouth of the Flodweg River, Harboursjaw is the provincial capital of [[Jaw]]. This city serves as the main port and economic hub of the region. Its urban landscape reflects the area's layered history, with older districts showcasing pre-Steorrian and Steorrian architecture, while newer areas exhibit distinct Selvean influences. The former Steorrian citadel, now serving as the Selvean governor's residence, stands as a potent symbol of the recent change in governance. Economically, Harboursjaw relies heavily on maritime trade and shipbuilding. The province's strategic location has long made it a crucial point for controlling trade routes, a fact that has only grown in importance under Selvean rule. Recent changes in trade regulations and economic priorities under the new administration have led to significant adjustments in the local economy, affecting everything from shipbuilding practices to agricultural production.

The population of Harboursjaw is diverse, comprising native Grand Isle inhabitants, Steorrian colonists, and recent Selvean arrivals. This demographic mix has resulted in a complex social and cultural environment. Steorrian traditions, with their Old English inspirations, coexist and sometimes conflict with newly introduced Selvean customs. This cultural fusion is evident in various aspects of daily life, from religious practices to architectural styles.

Politically, Harboursjaw presents a complex picture. While now governed by Selvean officials, many Steorrian bureaucratic structures remain in place, leading to administrative challenges and political tensions. The presence of Steorrian loyalists, coupled with the recent memory of the war, contributes to an atmosphere of underlying tension. The Selvean military maintains a strong presence in the province, particularly naval forces in the main port, underscoring the area's strategic importance.

Religious life in Harboursjaw is equally multifaceted. Temples dedicated to the Unwavering Star, a faith brought by the Steorrians, stand alongside newly constructed pyramids honoring the Selvean pantheon. This religious diversity often mirrors the broader cultural and political divisions within the province.

Harboursjaw's unique position and recent history make it a crucial location in the broader context of archipelago politics and economics. Its development is closely watched by various powers, including Steorr, Selvea, and the Siblín Guilds.

In essence, Harboursjaw stands as a microcosm of the larger conflicts and changes shaping the archipelago. Its future development will likely have significant implications for the balance of power in the region, making it a key area of interest for scholars, politicians, and merchants alike.


The city's skyline is a testament to its layered history, with architectural styles spanning centuries and cultures.

The Old Town, nestled on the northern bank, features narrow, winding streets lined with half-timbered houses and sturdy stone buildings. Here, ale-houses and mead halls still echo with traditional ballads and tales of heroic deeds. The Market Square, once known as Céapstów, remains a hub of activity, though now it bears the marks of recent cultural shifts.

Dominating the city's highest point is the imposing Citadel, a formidable stone fortress that once served as the seat of Steorrian power. Its once austere walls now bear vibrant murals depicting the glory of the Selvean Empire. 

Across the river, the newly developed Selvean Quarter presents a stark contrast. Stepped pyramids, dedicated to the Selvean pantheon, rise above the rooftops, their sides adorned with intricate carvings and glyphs. The central plaza bustles with traders offering exotic goods from across the archipelago.

The riverside is a hive of activity, with docks stretching along both banks. Ships of various designs crowd the harbor - sturdy cogs with high sides, sleek vessels with triangular sails, and imposing warships bearing the marks of Selvean naval power.

Near the harbor stands the great lighthouse, its design a fusion of old and new. While its base retains the solid stonework of its original Steorrian construction, the upper levels have been rebuilt in the Selvean style, crowned with a platform where sacred fires are kept burning to guide ships and honor the sea deities.

Throughout the city, temples and shrines reflect the diverse spiritual landscape. Ancient stone circles dedicated to old nature spirits can be found in quiet corners, while imposing temples to the Unwavering Star stand near newly built pyramid-temples where Selvean priests conduct elaborate rituals.

The city's population is as diverse as its architecture. In the markets and squares, one might see Steorrian merchants with braided hair and heavy woolen cloaks haggling with Selvean traders adorned in vibrant feathered cloaks and jade jewelry. Native islanders, their customs a unique blend of influences, navigate this complex social tapestry with practiced ease.

Harboursjaw's defenses are a mix of old and new. The original city walls, built of solid stone in the Steorrian style, have been augmented with newer fortifications overseen by Selvean military engineers. Watchtowers along the coast have been repurposed to suit Selvean naval tactics, while the harbour chain, a massive iron barrier that can be raised to block enemy ships, remains a testament to Steorrian engineering.

In essence, Harboursjaw is a city of contrasts and amalgamations, where ancient traditions and new customs intermingle in every aspect of daily life. It stands as a living monument to the complex history of the region and a symbol of the ongoing cultural and political shifts shaping the archipelago.
