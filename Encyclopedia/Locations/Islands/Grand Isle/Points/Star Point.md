Star Point is a large [[Steorr|Steorrian]] city located on a tall rocky peninsula, overlooking [[Dots]] and connected to the rest of the [[Grand Isle]] by a thin strip of land. Protected by its geography, it also has a very strategically valuable position. It serves as the crossroads of trading routes in the North-West of the archipelago. 

Star Point gets its name from its location roughly under the [[Unwavering Star]]. Due to this, and although the seat of power of the [[Church of the Unwavering Star|Church]] is in the Old Lands, it is a major religious site for believers. Perched at the crest of the city's tallest hill, rests the Grand Cathedral. This ornate building is topped with a majestic eight-pointed crystalline dome through which light refracts, creating a dazzling display. Inside, the multi-coloured glows bathes intricate mosaics depicting holy scriptures. Pilgrims flock to the city to bask under the Star's radiance and the clergy direct religious services and rituals.

But Star Point is not just a spiritual centre; it is also a bustling, industrious, and cosmopolitan city. It radiates out in rings from the star-shaped tiled plaza surrounding the Cathedral. Merchants, street performers, and laborers fill the streets between the rows of houses and shops. While the ubiquitous Church of the Unwavering Star wields heavy influence, it does not have absolute authority over local affairs. In practice, the city balances pious dedications with secular trade interests. [[Lady Mayor Theis]] rules the city and the surrounding province. She resides in one of the mansions that dot the hillsides overlooking the bay, along with wealthy nobles and successful merchants. 

Further down, lies a sprawling and thriving harbour district, with its warehouses and merchant company buildings. At the water's edge, monumental stone walls and iron cannons stand sentinel, protecting the harbour and its fleet of merchant ships and fishing trawlers that are the city's lifeblood.
