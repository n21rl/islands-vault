Area drained to bottom of sea, dragged islands in spiral pattern
This odd geographical formation resembles a series of small islands arranged in a spiral pattern. Legends say the islands were mysteriously dragged into position long ago by an ancient sea creature seeking to create a monument. The waters within the spiral are unusually shallow and still, making navigation tricky. Strange singing can sometimes be heard at night coming from the centre.
