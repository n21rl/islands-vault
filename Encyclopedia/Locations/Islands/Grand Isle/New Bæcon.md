New Bæcon is the capital city of the Steorrian colony in the Islands, located near the western coast of the Grand Isle at the convergence of two major rivers. Originally founded approximately 150 years ago as Steorr expanded its reach overseas, New Bæcon quickly grew into the administrative heart of the colonial government.

The Governor's Palace, an imposing mansion, sits on a hill overlooking the settlement and serves as the official residence and workplace of the reigning royal governor who oversees the colony on behalf of the homeland monarchy. The Legislature Assembly building not far downhill is home to the elected Colonial Council that makes local laws.

Further inland from the palatial district, the Colonial Mint churns out coins bearing the kingdom's sigil. The streets winding towards the riverside wharfs are crowded with colonial bureaucrats and officials bustling about official affairs. Soldiers drilled in the Steorrian style regularly march through the tidy brick plazas.

Yet punctuating the stately white Classical buildings are the simple timber structures of fisherfolk and plantation farmers whose work fuels the colony's economy. Down by the rivers, moored ships load tobacco, cotton, and sugarcane grown on vast inland plantations for export back to the homeland.

While the official business of governance occurs in palatial offices, much activity spills out onto thoroughfares and trading halls. New Bæcon blends imperial Old World order with frontier pioneers, a distinctive hybrid capital overseeing Steorr's burgeoning expansion overseas.
