Landfall is situated a short distance from New Bæcon on the western coast of Grand Isle. It earned its name from being the location where Steorrian explorers first arrived in the Islands centuries ago after months traversing the open ocean.

To honor that fateful landfall, the explorers' ships were hauled ashore and converted into the Chapel of First Light, now a historic landmark. Other simple timber buildings were soon constructed around it as more settlers arrived. Over time, Landfall grew into a small picturesque city.

Though it was eclipsed by New Bæcon as the colonial capital, Landfall still retains its village charm. Whitewashed cottages with flower boxes line cobbled lanes that meander to the harborfront promenade. Historic plaques mark sites like the original landing spot and the explorers' camp.

At dusk, locals and tourists alike flock to the harbor to watch the sunset over the waters that first brought pioneers to these islands so long ago. The proud ship-turned-chapel still stands as a testament to the seafaring roots of the Steorrian colony's founding. By day, visitors flock to Landfall's quaint cafes, boutiques, and inns seeking an idyllic retreat from bustling New Bæcon.
