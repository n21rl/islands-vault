Parchminster Abbey is the principal house of the Cyridithite Sisters, the religious order devoted to Saint Cyridith, patron of knowledge, law, and the written word. It stands on a low rise above the town of Parchminster in the Old Lands, where the steady sound of bells and quills has marked the passing of centuries.

Origins

The Abbey grew from an earlier foundation — a modest church and convent dedicated to the Star — that once served as a resting place for travellers between the northern provinces. In time, several learned sisters from Steorr petitioned to establish a house there under the name of Saint Cyridith. Their purpose was to preserve and copy sacred texts, and to provide learned counsel to the Church and Concord alike.

With royal and ecclesiastical patronage, the old convent expanded into a true abbey. The new Abbess of Parchminster, elected by her peers, took charge of a growing community of scholars, scribes, and novices. By the later Concord-Kingship, the Abbey’s scriptoria were known throughout Steorr for their clarity, precision, and unerring orthography.

Rule and Order

The Sisters follow the Rule of Saint Cyridith, which places study and transcription at the heart of devotion. Speech within the scriptorium is forbidden save for prayer or correction. Every Sister learns the arts of copying, illumination, and record-keeping, with emphasis on fidelity to the source above all ornament. Errors are confessed publicly, and manuscripts are corrected rather than destroyed, as a mark of humility before truth.

The Abbess oversees the governance of the house, assisted by the Prioress, the Mistress of the Scriptorium, and the Archivist of Records. Daily life is austere but ordered: hours of study and labour are balanced by communal prayer, teaching, and careful maintenance of the Abbey’s vast archives.

The Great Scriptorium

The Great Scriptorium is the heart of Parchminster. Its desks, arranged beneath tall arched windows, host dozens of Sisters working in near silence. Each manuscript is checked three times before being sealed with the Abbey’s mark — a quill crossed with an open book — signifying authenticity and approval.

Over the centuries, Parchminster’s manuscripts have become the authoritative versions of many Steorrian religious and legal texts. Even royal edicts and concordant treaties are often recopied here before entering the official record.

Scholarship and Influence

The Abbey’s authority is both spiritual and intellectual. Its commentaries on the Lives of the Saints and the Concord Codex are studied in every major city of the Old Lands. Students, clerks, and apprentices travel long distances to learn from the Sisters’ methods, though few are admitted into the order itself.

The Abbess of Parchminster holds a seat of honour at ecclesiastical councils and serves as advisor on questions of language, law, and canon. Her influence is felt in the phrasing of oaths, the preservation of archives, and the education of Steorrian clergy.

Reputation

To call something “Parchminster work” is to praise it as faultless and true. The Abbey’s manuscripts are valued across Steorr for their careful craftsmanship, and many secular scribes model their training upon Cyridithite standards. Though the Sisters seldom leave their walls, their words reach every corner of the realm.

Legacy

Today, the quiet town of Parchminster thrives around the Abbey’s outer courts. Pilgrims come to see the manuscripts, and merchants trade the fine inks and vellum used within. The Abbey remains a living monument to Saint Cyridith’s ideal: that the written word, faithfully kept, is the surest path to order and understanding.
