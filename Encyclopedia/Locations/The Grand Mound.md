### 
(Once a Temple, Now a Hollowed Throne)
- What It Was:
    - The largest plant-mound, considered the most sacred site.
    - A gathering place for rituals and leadership.
    - Oraya I (Lanternhead’s child) may have lived here as a leader before the village fell.
- What It Is Now:
    - Goblins have dug into its roots, carving out a throne chamber inside.
    - The current goblin leader (or their fey ally) sits atop a crude, makeshift seat inside the mound.
    - The great mask that once adorned it has been defaced—either repainted mockingly or cracked in half.
    - Some goblins fear the mound is still haunted—they hear noises inside, but no one dares to go too deep.

⮕ Potential Story Hook: If Lanternhead or Mo explore inside, they might find remnants of past rituals, carvings of ancestors, or even Oraya I’s name.


## Shared Site: The Grand Mound
Theme: Memory, reverence, power, loss

The Grand Mound is the largest surviving Tetzilwahi structure—part temple, part archive, part cradle. Its interior is half-collapsed, overgrown, and spiritually volatile. Masks hang from the ceiling. Illusions still flicker in the air. Spirits may linger, fractured and confused.

Each faction projects their own belief onto the Mound:
- Bonepickers want its relics and dominance.
- Maskbearers want to purify and ritualize it.
- Vine-Taken want to seed it and let it rot.

Control of the Mound influences the jungle’s magical balance and may trigger vision storms, ancestral awakenings, or Yaya’s intervention.
