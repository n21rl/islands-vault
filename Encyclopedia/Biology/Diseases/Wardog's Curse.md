Wardog’s Curse, also known as Ragged Fever or Balding Madness, is a highly infectious and devastating disease that primarily affects hirsute humanoids such as Bugbears, Clawed Clans, and other furred Beastfolk. The illness, believed to have originated from Steorrian war dogs and livestock, first appeared in the Islands following the expansion of Steorrian colonial settlements. Unlike other plagues, Wardog’s Curse does not merely weaken the body—it attacks the nervous system, causing paranoia, violent aggression and ultimately death.

While humans and other minimally-haired creatures can carry the disease, they rarely suffer its full effects. This has led to widespread fear, segregation, and unrest as the afflicted are shunned, quarantined, or outright exterminated in an effort to contain outbreaks.

## Contracting the disease
Wardog’s Curse is highly infectious, spreading through fur and hair, saliva and blood, bites and claw wounds.  An exposed creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Furred creatures roll this save with disadvantage and do not apply their proficiency bonus to the roll. Symptoms manifest one day after infection.

## Symptoms and Disease progression
An infected creature might go through three disease stages, followed by death. At dawn each day, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Furred creatures roll with disadvantage and do not apply their proficiency bonus to the roll. For each stage, three failures cause the disease to progress to the next stage (or death after stage 3), while three successes end the infection.

One of the main symptoms is debilitating restlessness. For each stage of the disease, the creature gains 1 [Exhaustion](app://obsidian.md/Published/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level. Long Rest does not reduce the creature's Exhaustion level. 

Additionally, it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points it would regain through any mean. . 

There are also other physical and mental symptoms. The table below presents the stages of the disease and the associated symptoms.

| Stage | Exhaustion levels | Physical symptoms                                 | Mental symptoms                                                                 |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | 1                 | Fever, skin tingling at hair roots                | Irritability                                                                    |
| 2     | 2                 | Hair shedding, muscle spasms                      | Paranoia: When stressed, DC14 wisdom save. Failure: frightened for 1 min.       |
| 3     | 3                 | Complete hair loss, cracking skin, jerky movement | Aggression: When stressed, DC 14 Wisdom save. Faillure: attack nearest creature |

## Fighting the Contagion
- Three Constitution save successes in a stage end the infection. Mental symptoms cease immediately, while physical symptoms may take *1d4 x stage number* days to return to normal.
- Lesser Restoration allows an infected creature to reroll a failed Constitution save, taking the new result.
- Greater Restoration or similar magic ends the disease immediately.
- A cured creature is no longer contagious and is immune to reinfection.

At the DM's discretion, other treatments may be effective.

## History, Cultural and Political Impact
### Traditional Remedies
- Various herbal pastes and heat treatments reduce symptoms but do not stop progression.
- Some afflicted attempt self-imposed exile, wandering into the wilderness to die alone rather than risk harming loved ones.
- Some Bugbear believe that the meat of a great beast grants strength to fight the disease

### Steorrian Medical Doctrine _(Brutal, But Effective)_
- Quarantine Camps—Infected individuals or communities are immediately isolated to stop outbreaks.
- Mandatory Fur Removal—Some cities require Beastfolk to shave completely before being allowed entry.
- Mass Culling of Infected Populations—Some villages are deemed lost causes and are burned to the ground with all inhabitants inside.

### The Decline of Fur-Based Traditions
- Many Beastfolk abandon fur-based customs out of fear, leading to the loss of cultural identity.
- Warriors once revered for their thick manes and fur now shave to avoid suspicion.
- Survivors with permanent baldness or patchy fur become outcasts, feared as living reminders of the disease.

## The Native Resistance
- Some radicals weaponize infected fur, leaving it in Steorrian barracks as an act of revenge
- Quarantine laws have become an excuse for forces to destroy entire villages under the guise of containment.
- Some question whether Steorrians truly brought the disease by accident or if it was deliberate
### The Marked Ones (Survivors of the Disease)
- Those who survive Wardog’s Curse may be changed forever. They are permanently hairless, with pale, leathery skin and sunken eyes.
- Some believe they carry unnatural instincts—heightened senses, near immunity to pain, or increased aggression.
- They are viewed with equal parts reverence and fear—some see them as cursed, others as chosen warriors of fate.

Wardog’s Curse is not eradicated. It remains a recurring nightmare, resurfacing in isolated outbreaks, particularly in regions where Steorrian war dogs and livestock remain in use.
