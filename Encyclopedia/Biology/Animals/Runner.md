## **Overview**

The **Runner** (_Dromornis velocis_) is a large, flightless bird found in **savannas, jungles, and arid steppe regions**. Built for **speed, endurance, and combat**, it stands nearly **10 feet tall** and can reach **tremendous speeds**, rivaling the fastest land animals. Unlike docile riding animals, Runners are **highly temperamental and intelligent**, forming deep bonds with a single rider while remaining **wild and unpredictable** to outsiders.

A favored mount among **Jawist scouts, Selvean warriors, and nomadic traders**, the Runner is **not just a beast of burden but a formidable war creature**. With its **razor-sharp beak, crushing kicks, and innate survival instincts**, it is as much a weapon as it is a mount.

Legends among certain cultures speak of **"Ghost Runners"**, creatures that **never tame and never stop running**, passing from one rider to the next, forever roaming the land.



## **Physical Characteristics**

### **Size & Build**

The Runner is a **towering avian**, standing between **8 and 10 feet (2.4–3 meters) tall** and weighing **400–500 lbs (180–225 kg)**. It has a **sleek, muscular body**, built for **high-speed sprints and sustained travel**.

### **Feathers & Coloration**

- **Short, sleek feathers** reduce wind resistance, similar to an ostrich or cassowary.
- **Earthy tones** dominate their plumage, ranging from **dark browns and blacks** to **dappled blues and deep greens** in jungle breeds.
- **Iridescent streaks** appear along the head and neck in **mature individuals**, serving as a display of dominance.

### **Head & Beak**

- The **head is elongated and narrow**, allowing for **precise, rapid strikes**.
- A **sharp, hooked beak** can be used to **tear flesh, crack bone, or grip prey**.
- Some breeds have **a bony crest or casque**, much like a cassowary, used for **intimidation and headbutting rivals**.
- **Eyes are large and predatory**, usually **gold, amber, or piercing green**, adapted for **long-distance vision**.

### **Legs & Feet**

- **Extremely long and powerful legs**, capable of **sprinting up to 50 mph (80 km/h) in short bursts**.
- Three-toed **clawed feet** allow for both traction and self-defense, with **a middle talon adapted for slashing**.
- Runners rely on **explosive leg power** for their signature **charge attack**, making them ideal for **hit-and-run tactics**.

### **Tail & Balance**

- A **short, rigid tail** acts as a **counterbalance**, allowing for **sharp turns and rapid direction changes**.
- Some breeds have **plumed tails**, which they flare when **agitated or preparing to charge**.



## **Temperament & Behavior**

Unlike common mounts, **Runners are intelligent, independent creatures**. They will not tolerate weak or cruel handlers and require **constant trust-building** from their riders.

### **Social Structure & Bonding**

- Runners are **solitary or live in loose roaming groups**, with **dominant individuals leading migrations**.
- **They bond with only one rider at a time**—a Runner that loses its bonded handler may refuse another for months or years.
- **If mistreated, a Runner will either turn on its rider or escape**, disappearing into the wilds.

### **Diet & Survival Instincts**

- **Omnivorous**—feeds on **roots, berries, small animals, and carrion**.
- **Capable of going days without water**, storing excess in an internal reservoir much like a camel.
- **Uses speed as a primary defense**, capable of **outpacing most predators**.

### **Defensive & Aggressive Behavior**

Runners are **not prey animals**—they are **territorial, aggressive, and extremely dangerous when provoked**.

- **Crushing Kicks** – A single **well-placed kick** can shatter ribs or knock an opponent unconscious.
- **Beak Strike** – A precise lunge can **tear through armor** or **crush small bones**.
- **Charging Impact** – When running at full speed, a Runner can **slam into enemies**, sending them flying.
- **Feather-Flare Display** – When agitated, a Runner will **puff up its plumage, stomp the ground, and emit a deep, throaty call**, intimidating weaker opponents.



## **Domestication & Cultural Significance**

### **Selvean Warriors & Jungle Scouts**

- The **fastest and fiercest Runners** are trained as **war mounts**, used by **Selvean cavalry and jungle scouts**.
- A Runner that survives multiple battles is **painted with sacred dyes**, and warriors who lose their mounts must **undertake a pilgrimage to find a new one in the wild**.
- In Selvean culture, **only the strongest warriors may ride a Runner into battle**—anyone else is seen as unworthy.

### **Jawist Resistance & Nomadic Clans**

- **Jawist scouts and guerrilla fighters** use Runners for **hit-and-run skirmishes**, allowing them to **strike and disappear before reinforcements arrive**.
- Some clans believe Runners carry **the spirits of past warriors**, their unbroken lines **stretching back generations**.
- A young warrior seeking to prove themselves must **tame a wild Runner without aid**, often **living alongside the creature for months** before it accepts them.

### **Steorrian Perception & Use**

- **Steorrian colonists and cavalry forces struggle to tame Runners**, often viewing them as **wild, untrustworthy beasts**.
- Some **frontier lords** keep **captive-bred Runners** as **status symbols**, though these birds are often **less intelligent and more docile** than their wild counterparts.
