Mossback Llama

Overview

The Mossback Llama is a hardy, sure-footed beast native to the jungled highlands and misty plateaus of the Islands. Unlike its domesticated cousins, the Mossback has adapted to its environment in a truly remarkable way—its thick, dense wool provides the perfect host for moss, vines, and fungi, blending it seamlessly into the undergrowth. Used by traders, nomads, and wilderness dwellers, the Mossback is valued not only for its endurance and resilience but also for the unique ecosystem it carries on its back.

Among certain cultures, particularly in Selvea and Jawist lands, the Mossback is considered a living bridge between beast and forest, a creature that does not merely travel through the jungle but becomes a part of it. Some whisper that the oldest Mossbacks do not die but simply stop moving, their bodies slowly taken over by the very plants they carried—standing silent in the jungle like ancient, moss-covered statues.



Physical Characteristics

Size & Build

The Mossback Llama is larger and heavier than the common breeds found in Steorrian settlements, standing at 6 to 7 feet (1.8–2.1 meters) at the head and weighing 600 to 900 pounds (270–410 kg). Its body is compact and muscular, built for carrying heavy loads across treacherous terrain.

Fur & Plant Growth

Its thick wool absorbs and holds moisture, making it a perfect host for plant life. However, contrary to myths, Mossbacks do not become overgrown walking gardens—rather, their coats develop patches of moss, tangled vines, and small ferns in places where moisture lingers.

Jungle Mossbacks: Have darker, slicker wool with tendrils of vines and hanging moss, particularly around the shoulders and back.

Highland Mossbacks: Thicker, paler coats, speckled with lichen and hardy alpine moss.

Marshland Mossbacks: Damp, moss-heavy wool that absorbs water, preventing dehydration in dry spells.


Head & Facial Features

Large, alert eyes with horizontal pupils give it exceptional peripheral vision, crucial for detecting predators.

Soft, rounded ears capable of detecting the faintest sounds, from shifting undergrowth to approaching strangers.

A strong jaw and grinding teeth, allowing it to chew through tough bark, fibrous roots, and wet vegetation.


Legs & Feet

Padded feet with two wide toes, allowing it to move silently through the jungle while maintaining traction on muddy, loose, or rocky ground.

Extremely stable, capable of navigating steep cliffs, wet stones, and tangled roots where a horse would stumble.





Temperament & Behavior

Mossback Llamas are known for their calm, observant nature, but their stubbornness is legendary. Unlike horses or donkeys, a Mossback does not simply follow orders—it must agree to them.

Social Structure & Bonding

Semi-social, forming small herds (3-10 individuals), led by an older, dominant female.

Once bonded to a rider or handler, a Mossback will be loyal for life, though it does not tolerate mistreatment.

If it does not trust its handler, it will simply refuse to move, no matter how much it is pushed.


Diet & Survival Instincts

Browses constantly, feeding on leaves, bark, moss, fungi, and fruit.

Can go for days without food, absorbing nutrients from the moisture and plants in its own wool.

Prefers to remain still when sensing danger, relying on its natural camouflage rather than flight.


Defensive Behavior

Though not an aggressive creature, a Mossback Llama will defend itself and its herd when provoked.

Crushing Kicks – A single, well-placed kick from a Mossback can break ribs or send a predator sprawling.

Spitting Deterrent – It can spit a foul-smelling, acidic saliva at attackers, temporarily blinding them.

Silent Escape – If flight is an option, a Mossback will vanish into the undergrowth without a trace, using its camouflage to disappear.


Domestication & Cultural Significance

In Selvean Society

The Mossback is a sacred beast in Selvean lands, associated with patience, endurance, and the eternal cycle of life.

Priests and scholars use them as companions in their jungle journeys, believing them to be living bridges between the mortal world and nature’s will.

In certain Selvean warrior traditions, a soldier who bonds with a Mossback is seen as having earned the jungle’s favor.

Some ancient Selvean texts speak of Great Mossbacks, enormous creatures that became one with the land, their bodies now hidden beneath jungle ruins.


Among the Jawists

Resistance fighters prize Mossbacks for their ability to move quietly through enemy territory, making them the preferred pack animals of Jawist scouts and smugglers.

Some Jawist clans believe that if a warrior dies far from home, their spirit finds its way back to the jungle on the back of a Mossback.

A well-trained Mossback is as valuable as gold among Jawist nomads, often forming the backbone of entire caravan routes.


Steorrian Use & Perception

In Steorrian-held lands, Mossbacks are seen as strange and unreliable, but their endurance has made them prized cargo animals for jungle expeditions.

Some frontier lords keep them as exotic curiosities, unaware that a Mossback who dislikes its owner will simply wander off one night and never return.





Notable Breeds & Regional Variants

Different regions have cultivated specialized breeds of Mossback Llamas:

1. Tideroot Mossback – Found in coastal wetlands, adapted for marshy terrain and humid climates.


2. Skybloom Mossback – A mountain-adapted variant, favored by highland traders for its thick wool and endurance.


3. Deepwood Mossback – Native to the dense inner jungles, known for near-complete silence when moving.


4. Ashback Mossback – A rare breed found in volcanic regions, with dark wool that resists heat and ash damage.
