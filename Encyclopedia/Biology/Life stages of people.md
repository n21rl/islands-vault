## Infant
*0–2 years*

Infants are wholly dependent on others, unable to survive without constant care. At this stage, personality is only beginning to emerge, but families and communities often project hopes, fears, and symbolism onto them.  

## Child
*3–12 years*

Children are learning rapidly, exploring their world and forming early identities. They can be imaginative, mischievous, or eager to please, and are shaped heavily by their surroundings and those who raise them.  

## Adolescent
*13–17 years*

Adolescence is marked by transition. Physical growth accelerates, emotions run strong, and individuals begin to test boundaries. It is a time of uncertainty and potential, where loyalties, values, and ambitions start to take form.  

## Young Adult
*18–25 years*

Young adults often seek independence and recognition. They may take risks, pursue new opportunities, or throw themselves into causes and relationships with intensity. This stage tends to be defined by experimentation and restlessness.  

## Adult
*26–45 years*

Adulthood represents physical and mental maturity. Many are established in some fashion, though what that looks like varies widely: work, family, craft, or wandering paths. This is often seen as the period of greatest capability and stability.  

## Middle-aged  
*46–65 years*

Middle age brings experience and perspective, but also signs of physical decline. People in this stage may reassess priorities, take on roles of guidance, or confront the weight of earlier choices. It is a period where endurance and memory often matter more than speed or strength.  

## Elder  
*66+ years*

Elders have reach the last stage of a normal mortal life. Some are frail, others still vigorous, but all carry long memory and the authority of survival. How they are treated depends on culture. They might be revered as sources of wisdom, or simply regarded as those who have endured.

## Ancient  
*100+ years*

Ancients are extraordinary outliers, mortal individuals who surpass the limits of ordinary life. They embody continuity across generations, often serving as living links to a past no one else remembers.

## Timeless  
*1000+ years*

Timeless beings exist far beyond the measure of years. Whether immortal by nature, curse, or magic, they are less individuals of a single era than fixtures across many. To mortals, they often represent permanence — a reminder that some things endure when all else fades.
