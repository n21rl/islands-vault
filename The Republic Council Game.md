## **The Republic Council Game**
*A solo role-play framework for exploring the political evolution of New Destiny*

### **Core Concept**
Play as the Republic Council over 6–12 monthly turns, making policy decisions through in-character debates and watching consequences ripple through factions, NPCs, and the region's power balance. [1][3]

***

### **Setup Phase**

#### **Starting Conditions** (Current State)
Based on session records, the Republic has just formally established itself. [3]

**Polity Stats** (scale 1–10):
- **Prosperity:** 4 (new trade routes, but limited infrastructure) [2]
- **Security:** 5 (pirate captains united, but no navy or fortifications) [1]
- **Legitimacy:** 3 (other powers view them as outlaws; internal Code still being tested) [1]
- **Morale:** 7 (founding euphoria; shared purpose) [3]

**Treasury:** 5,000 gp (starting funds from pooled loot and early trade)

**Territory:** New Destiny island, plus informal control over 3–4 Northern Scattered Isle anchorages [2]

#### **Council Roster**
Assign each captain a **priority** and **voting weight** based on crew size. [1]

| Captain | Crew Size | Votes | Primary Interest | Red Line (Won't Compromise) |
|---------|-----------|-------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Captain Morgan** | 120 | 4 | Naval dominance, trade disruption | No surrender to Steorr [1] |
| **Wayne MacGoshan** (Bards) | 80 | 3 | Cultural identity, freedom of expression | No censorship of songs/art [1] |
| **Calico Jack** (Reed Rangers) | 60 | 2 | Personal freedom, LGBTQ+ inclusion | No gender-based discrimination [4] |
| **Luna Mahina** | 50 | 2 | Spiritual/mystical autonomy, revenge on Steorr | No whaling in sacred waters [3] |
| **Orguk** | 15 | 1 | Personal glory, proving himself | Must have command opportunity [3] |
| **Star & Dove Adventurers** | 25 | 1 | Protection of non-combatants, ethical piracy | No civilian targeting [3] |

**Total Council Votes:** 13 (7 needed to pass)

#### **Faction Tracker** (External Powers)
Track each faction's **stance toward the Republic** (scale: –5 hostile to +5 allied) and **current pressure**. [1]

| Faction | Starting Stance | Pressure | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| **Steorr Colony** | –4 (active threat) | High—Fletcher's outpost expanding [4] |
| **Sibln Guilds** | –2 (economic rivals) | Medium—trade competition, prison break fallout [1] |
| **Selvea** | 0 (neutral, wary) | Low—observing [5] |
| **Green Salt Trading Co.** | –3 (personal vendetta) | Medium—Brummbär wants revenge [3] |
| **Guildless** | +1 (sympathetic) | Low—potential recruits [1] |
| **Northern Scattered Tribes** | +2 (cautiously friendly) | Low—want fair trade [3] |

***

### **Turn Structure** (20–40 minutes per turn)

#### **Phase 1: Event Roll** (5 min)
Roll 1d6 or choose an event from the table below. Read it aloud as an in-world report to the Council. [3]

| d6 | Event | Immediate Effect |
|----|-------|------------------|
| 1 | **Steorrian Patrol Sighted** | Security –1; captains demand action |
| 2 | **Trade Windfall** | Prosperity +1; Treasury +1,000 gp |
| 3 | **Diplomatic Envoy Arrives** | Legitimacy test—neutral faction seeks treaty |
| 4 | **Internal Dispute** | Morale –1; two captains clash over resources |
| 5 | **Vintage Smuggling Ring Exposed** | Security –1; Guild pressure increases [6] |
| 6 | **Hero's Return** | Morale +1; famous pirate joins Republic |

Customize events to reflect ongoing story threads (Fletcher's movements, Vintage conspiracy, Guild retaliation). [6][4]

#### **Phase 2: Council Debate** (10–15 min)
Present **one major decision** requiring a vote. Each captain gets a voice—**you role-play all of them** in turn, using 1–2 sentences per captain. [1]

**Sample Issues:**
- Allocate 2,000 gp: fortify New Destiny harbor **or** fund scouting missions **or** subsidize merchant recruitment? [2]
- Respond to Steorrian patrol: ambush them **or** evade and observe **or** send diplomatic letter? [4]
- Handle Vintage crisis: ban it **or** regulate and tax **or** ignore it? [6]
- Guildless refugees seek asylum: accept all **or** screen for skills **or** turn away? [1]

**Role-play template:**
- **Captain Morgan:** "We strike the patrol now—hesitation is weakness. Every day we wait, Steorr digs in deeper." [1]
- **Wayne MacGoshan:** "A song of defiance is worth a thousand swords. Let's make them fear the fog." [1]
- **Calico Jack:** "Attacking them makes us warmongers. We should prove we're better than Steorr, not just louder." [4]
- **Luna Mahina:** "The spirits demand blood for blood. But timing matters—let me consult the tides first." [3]
- **Orguk:** "Give me a crew and I'll bring you their flag by sunrise." [3]
- **Star & Dove Rep:** "If we strike, we hit military targets only. No prisoners tortured, no looting of personal effects." [3]

**Vote:** Tally votes based on crew size. Record who voted for what—this creates political capital and grudges. [1]

#### **Phase 3: Resolution & Consequences** (10–15 min)
Apply the decision's effects to stats and factions, then **generate 2–3 downstream story beats** for NPCs or locations. [4][2]

**Example Resolution:**
- **Decision:** Council votes 8–5 to ambush the Steorrian patrol. [1]
- **Stat Changes:** Security +2 (short-term tactical win), Legitimacy –1 (other powers see aggression), Treasury –500 gp (resupply costs). [1]
- **Faction Reactions:**
  - Steorr: Stance drops to –5; Fletcher accelerates fortification. [4]
  - Northern Tribes: +1 stance (impressed by Republic's boldness). [3]
  - Guildless: No change, but some volunteer as scouts. [1]
- **NPC Story Beats:**
  1. Vesper Martini returns with intelligence: Steorr is hiring mercenaries. [1]
  2. Elora's inn in New Destiny sees refugee influx from contested waters; Ham overhears Steorrian spy. [4]
  3. Orguk demands recognition for leading the ambush; Geera publicly praises him, increasing his confidence. [4]

**Capture these in a turn log** (1-page summary with bullet points). [3]

#### **Phase 4: Upkeep** (5 min)
- **Check thresholds:** If any stat drops below 3, trigger a crisis next turn (mutiny, economic collapse, mass desertion). [1]
- **Advance external threats:** Fletcher's outpost grows by 10% each turn unless actively opposed. [4]
- **Update NPC positions:** Track who's rising (Orguk gaining respect) or falling (Vesper under suspicion). [4][1]

***

### **Advanced Mechanics**

#### **Political Capital**
Captains who vote with the majority gain **+1 Influence**; those who oppose lose –1. At 5 Influence, a captain can force a revote once per session. At –3, they threaten to leave the Council. [1]

#### **Secret Agendas**
Assign hidden goals to 2–3 captains each game:
- Wayne is covertly recruiting Guildless for a cultural revolution. [1]
- Luna Mahina is planning unsanctioned revenge raid on whalers. [3]
- Orguk is in debt to Captain Morgan and must vote with him twice. [3][1]

Reveal these mid-game when triggered by events. [3]

#### **Ticking Clocks**
Track multi-turn threats:
- **Fletcher's Outpost:** 0/10 progress. At 10, he launches invasion. [4]
- **Vintage Crisis:** 0/6 exposure. At 6, internal conspiracy explodes. [6]
- **Guild Retaliation:** 0/8 escalation. At 8, Sibln blockade begins. [1]

Each turn, clocks advance by 1 unless the Council takes action to slow them. [3]

#### **Character Scenes**
After each turn, write a **100-word vignette** from one NPC's perspective reacting to the Council's decision:
- Hugh Bowes scheming in Sealtham after hearing of the ambush. [4]
- Ham sneaking into the Auction House to spy on Guild agents. [4]
- Moku performing a Tanawhu ritual in New Destiny's undercroft. [3]

These anchor the abstract politics to lived experiences. [4]

***

### **Victory & Endgame Conditions**

**Win Conditions** (achieve 2 of 3):
1. All four stats above 6 for three consecutive turns. [1]
2. Sign a formal treaty with one major power (Selvea, Siblns, or a Northern alliance). [5][1]
3. Neutralize Fletcher's outpost or another existential threat. [4]

**Loss Conditions** (any one):
1. Two stats drop below 2 simultaneously (Republic fragments). [1]
2. Three captains leave the Council (no quorum). [1]
3. External power conquers New Destiny. [2][4]

***

### **Sample First Turn**

**Event (d6 = 5):** Vintage smuggling ring exposed in New Destiny; guards find Wesson family's stash in a warehouse. Legitimacy threatened if Republic seen as lawless. [6][1]

**Council Question:** How do we respond?
- **Option A:** Public trial and execution of smugglers (Legitimacy +2, Morale –2, Guildless –1 stance)
- **Option B:** Confiscate and redistribute Vintage to crew as "hazard pay" (Morale +2, Legitimacy –2, Guild –1 stance)
- **Option C:** Quiet expulsion; sell Vintage back to Sibln black market (Treasury +800 gp, Security –1, hidden Wesson resentment)

**Debate snippet:**
- Morgan: "Execute them. We're not smugglers anymore—we're a nation." [1]
- Wayne: "The Vintage keeps my crew sane between raids. Redistribute it." [1]
- Calico: "Exile fits the Code. Killing sends the wrong message about second chances." [4]

**Vote Result:** 7–6 for Option A (execution). [1]

**Consequences:**
- Legitimacy +2, Morale –2 (crew grumbles about harsh justice)
- Wesson family (in absentia) now враждебна to Republic—future sabotage likely [1]
- NPC beat: Guz at the gun shop refuses to sell to Wayne's crew in protest [4]
