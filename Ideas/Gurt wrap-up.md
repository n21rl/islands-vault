Thank you for the information. Here is one possible way to wrap up Gurt's story:

The party decides to pursue Grey and her crew, hoping to find out the secret behind her apparent immortality and stop her from terrorizing the Scattered Isles. They manage to track down the Grey Phantom to a hidden cove, where they discover that Grey has been using a powerful artifact called the Chronos Shard, a fragment of a shattered time crystal that can manipulate time. Grey has been using it to slow down her aging and create temporal anomalies that allow her to escape and plunder. The party confronts Grey and her crew, and a fierce battle ensues. Gurt manages to get close enough to Grey and uses his artificer skills to sabotage the Chronos Shard, causing it to malfunction and explode. The explosion creates a temporal rift that sucks in Grey and Gurt, along with some of her crew. The rest of the party manages to escape the cove before it collapses.

The party later learns that Gurt and Grey were transported to another time and place, where they continued their rivalry. Gurt eventually found a way to return to his own time, but decided to stay and explore the new world he found himself in. He sent a letter to his former companions, telling them that he was happy and grateful for their friendship. He also sent them a map of his discoveries and some of his inventions as gifts. He signed off with his usual motto: "There's always more to see."

I apologize for presuming. Here is another possible way to wrap up Gurt's story:

The explosion creates a temporal rift that sucks in Grey and Gurt, along with some of her crew. The rest of the party manages to escape the cove before it collapses.

The party has a few options to try to rescue Gurt:

- They can try to find another fragment of the Chronos Shard and use it to reopen the temporal rift, hoping to find Gurt and Grey on the other side. This option is risky, as they might end up in a different time and place than Gurt, or attract unwanted attention from other time travelers or temporal anomalies.
- They can try to contact a powerful mage or entity that can manipulate time and ask for their help in locating and retrieving Gurt. This option is costly, as they might have to pay a high price or perform a dangerous favor for their benefactor.
- They can try to wait for Gurt to return on his own, trusting that he will find a way back with his ingenuity and curiosity. This option is uncertain, as they might never see Gurt again, or he might return after a long time has passed for him or them.

Depending on their choice, the outcome of Gurt's story might vary:

- If they manage to find and rescue Gurt, they will reunite with their old friend and learn about his adventures in another time and place. Gurt will be grateful for their efforts and will share his discoveries and inventions with them. He might also have some unfinished business with Grey, who might have escaped or followed him back.
- If they fail to find or rescue Gurt, they will mourn the loss of their companion and wonder what happened to him. They might receive some clues or messages from him through time, indicating that he is alive and well somewhere else. They might also encounter some of his inventions or descendants in their travels.
- If they decide to wait for Gurt, they will hope for his return and keep his memory alive. They might be surprised or delighted when he eventually shows up, either in their present or in their future. He might have aged differently than them, or have changed in other ways. He might also bring back some friends or enemies from his travels.

Okay, I will try to give you more detailed suggestions. Here are some possible situations for Gurt to confront Grey:

- The party is hired by the Sibl√≠n Guilds to escort a valuable cargo to one of their outposts in the Islands. Along the way, they are attacked by the Grey Phantom and its crew. Gurt recognizes Grey's voice and signature illusions, and decides to board her ship and confront her face to face. He finds her in her cabin, surrounded by strange devices and arcane symbols. She reveals that she has been using a powerful artifact called the Chronolock, which allows her to manipulate time and age. She used it to escape from the raid that Gurt was captured in, and has been using it ever since to prolong her life and evade capture. She offers Gurt a chance to join her and share the benefits of the Chronolock, or to die as an old fool.
- The party is contacted by a mysterious benefactor who claims to have information about Grey and her crew. They agree to meet him at a secret location in one of the Scattered Isles. There, they find a hidden base where several clones of Grey are being kept in stasis pods. The benefactor reveals himself as Gurt's old captain, who was betrayed and replaced by Grey years ago. He explains that Grey is actually a rogue agent of a secret organization that experiments with cloning and mind control. She stole his identity and his ship, and has been creating clones of herself to infiltrate and sabotage various factions in the Islands. He asks Gurt and the party to help him stop Grey and expose her plot.
- The party is invited by the Clawed Clans to attend a festival on their island. There, they witness a ritual where a chosen champion of the clans fights against a fearsome beast in a sacred arena. To their surprise, they see that the champion is none other than Grey, who has earned the respect and admiration of the clans with her bravery and cunning. She recognizes Gurt in the crowd and challenges him to join her in the arena. He accepts, hoping to settle their score once and for all. As they fight, Grey tells him that she left him behind because she saw his potential and wanted him to grow stronger on his own. She says that she has been traveling the Islands, seeking new challenges and experiences, and that she has found a home among the Clawed Clans. She asks Gurt to forgive her and join her as her partner.

These are some more detailed suggestions for how you could wrap up Gurt's character. I hope they are helpful.
