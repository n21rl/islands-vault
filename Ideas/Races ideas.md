Humanoid: Humans, Elves and all of the more regular races

Stoutfolk: Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes and most of the smaller races

Monstrous:  Dragonborn, orcs, goblins, plasmoids all those types

Beastfolk: Owlins, Minotaurs, Tabaxi 
Bird


Misc?: Pretty much everything else, maybe warforged although they could possibly fit into monstrous but I think that doesn’t fully work. Only other idea for this one is “artificial” which could fit in things like Simic hybrids as well as constructs like the warforged and Autognome

Giants: Goliath
