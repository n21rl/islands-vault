For all of these...
1. Schedule a Republic council meeting where players can present and debate these ideas.
2. Offer missions related to each proposal (e.g., leading a patrol, mapping an island, negotiating trade deals).
3. Present challenges that test the new systems (e.g., a trade dispute, diplomatic crisis, or military threat).
4. Introduce NPCs who support or oppose these changes to create dynamic interactions.
5. Gradually reveal the complex political landscape of the Islands as players engage in diplomacy.
