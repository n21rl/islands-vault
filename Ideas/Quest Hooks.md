A small island, convinced they are a frontier outpost of a long-dead ancient empire that they believe still exists.

The bones of a gigantic, long-dead creature that have clumped together to form a massive, jagged island. A hidden coven of necromancers are trying to reanimate the corpse, for nefarious purposes.

sea tavern, floating in the middle of the ocean, complete with barkeep, wenches, and a singing bard. Actually the head of a giant ocean-dwelling mimic-like monster whose diet consists of seafaring adventurers.

The remains of the old and forgotten SS Vast and Unsinkable live up to their name - the ship is almost 10 square miles in surface area, and completely unsunk, bobbing upside-down and distinctly island-like on the surface. Rumors tell of a great treasure- but beware the ghosts of her crew!
