## Summary
*Pilot boats are used to transport maritime pilots between land and incoming or outbound ships. The history of pilots and their work goes back to ancient times when local experienced harbour captains were employed. Pilots were self-employed and had to have quick transport to get them from the port to the incoming ships, so a new type of boat was required. Early boats were developed from single masted cutters and twin masted yawls, and latterly into the specialist pilot cutter.* 

A **pilot boat** is a type of boat used to transport [maritime pilots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_pilot) between land and the inbound or outbound ships that they are piloting. Pilot boats were once sailing boats that had to be fast because the first pilot to reach the incoming ship got the business. Today, pilot boats are scheduled by telephoning the ship agents/representatives prior to arrival.

Pilots and the work functions of the [maritime pilot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_pilot) go back to [Ancient Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) and [Roman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome) times, when incoming ships' captains employed locally experienced [harbour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour) captains, mainly local [fishermen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishermen), to bring their vessels safely into port. Eventually, in light of the need to regulate the act of pilotage and ensure pilots had adequate insurance, the harbours themselves licensed pilots for each harbour.

Although licensed by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, meaning that they had to have quick transport to get them from the port to the incoming ships. As pilots were often still dual-employed, they used their own [fishing boats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_boat) to reach the incoming vessels. But fishing boats were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, and so a new type of boat was required.

Early boats were developed from single masted [cutters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_(boat)) and twin masted [yawls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawl), and latterly into the specialist [pilot cutter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_cutter). These were effectively light-weight and over-powered single-masted boats with large, steeply angled keels, making them [deep draft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)) under power and shallow draft in lighter sail.

If legend is to be believed, the first official [Bristol Channel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Channel) pilot was barge master George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot [John Cabot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cabot)'s *[Matthew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_(ship))* from [Bristol harbour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_harbour) to the open sea beyond the [Bristol channel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_channel). In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided [Brunel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunel)'s *[SS Great Western](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Western),* and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger *[SS Great Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Britain)* on her maiden voyage.1(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_boat#cite_note-1)
