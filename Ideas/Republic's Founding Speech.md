> Mates! Today is a great day. As we sign our Code, we celebrate the founding of our Republic. We chose to live our lives as we see fit. The path ahead will be full of danger, but also adventure and riches, and songs.  So let's embrace the thrill and let's make a name for ourselves!

> Aye, in our Republic, there's room for everyone. No matter your race, gender, or past, you're welcome here, unbound by the chains of society. I myself have found acceptance that I never knew before. We're a motley crew, and that's our strength."

> Hear hear, no more will we bow to others' commands! We've cast off the shackles of those who would control us. Now, we embrace what truly keeps us alive - our wits, our skills, our tenacity, and each other. We are the masters of our fate!

> Mates, you know I've sailed under the flag of Steorr, and I've seen firsthand the oppression of these so called "great nations". But today, we reject tyranny and celebrate our independence! And so, as we sign this Code, let us remember why we're here. We've created something unique, a Republic built on freedom and equality. Nothing is as powerful, and we're only getting started. So raise your glass and raise our flag! To the Republic!"
