The festival of Balance is taking place of Harboursjaw. Selvea traditionally realigns their divine calendar with astronomical observations every 12 years. This year, Paxitli has decided that the idea of Balance should also be reflected between the people of the Jaw and is trying to foster peace and unity. One of the events is the Champions tournament, with skill trials, combat trials, team combat and individual combat, in both the Blood Path (physical) and Spirit path (magical), associated with the two branches of the elite Selvean fighters known as the Champions. The winners have a chance of becoming champions themselves, despite not being trained from youth and maybe not being Selvean. 

Champions are not participating, although they may have a demonstration at the end (or maybe a surprise battle with winners?)
Also, the structure is:
- two paths: blood path (physical warriors), spirit path (magical warriors) 
- successive eliminations in each path with stages of skill trials, combat trials, team combat, individual combat 
- grand final where winners from each path fight free for all 
- 1 night rest between each stage

The top participants have a chance of becoming Champions
