Here are some suggestions to add more nuance and shades of grey to their portrayal:ize Steorrian individuals
Rather than just presenting Steorr as a monolithic evil empire, give some Steorrian individuals more depth and complexity in their beliefs/motivations:
- A Steorrian soldier who questions the morality of their actions against natives
- A Church scholar genuinely convinced magic is dangerous heresy who isn't just a fanatic
- A colonial administrator harsh on the surface, but motivated by keeping order/preventing anarchy

Highlight internal conflicts
Show that Steorr itself is not united, with different groups/agendas within the power structure:
- Reformers within the Church who want a softer approach to conversion 
- Noble families more interested in profit from the colonies than religious crusading
- Locals in the colonies who have "gone native" and adopted syncretic beliefs

Give a positive side
While an imperial power, Steorr could have introduced some legitimately positive reforms/innovations:
- Ending tribal conflicts and unifying territories under common laws/language
- Improving agriculture, infrastructure, education in some areas
- Having a code outlawing certain inhumane practices of native groups

Shades of tradition
Their staunch views could be rooted in an ancient tragic event that makes Steorr's dogma more understandable:
- A cataclysmic magic war that drove their ancestors to renounce arcane forces
- A religious schism or divine betrayal that turned them against unchecked mysticism 
- They preserve ancient codes of metaphysics that see magic as destabilizing

Moral disagreements
Rather than pure oppression, there could be legitimate philosophical conflicts at the heart of Steorr's issues with natives:
- Steorr values order, natives value personal freedom - a clash of ideologies
- Steorr has rigid moral codes, while natives have more ethical relativism
- Steorr tries to uplift through conversion, natives see this as cultural erasure

Thank you for these thoughtful suggestions on adding more nuance and moral complexity to the portrayal of Steorr and its people. I think these are great ideas for making the civilization feel more three-dimensional and relatable.

Giving individual Steorrians depth, doubts, and varied motivations helps humanize them. Showing internal divisions and reformist elements adds realism. Mentioning some positive impacts of Steorrian rule, even if overall negative, acknowledges that history is complex. Rooting their hardline anti-magic views in understandable historical events makes their perspective more sympathetic. And framing the conflict as competing value systems and philosophies, not just oppression, raises thought-provoking questions.

Overall, I think selectively incorporating some of these elements would make for a richer, more nuanced portrayal of Steorr. It avoids making them one-dimensional villains, highlights how individuals can differ from their society, and surfaces the legitimate moral quandaries at the heart of the conflict. These shades of grey make for more compelling worldbuilding and storytelling. Well done coming up with these great suggestions! Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on or explore any of them further.
