After presenting evidence against the Wessons' Vintage operation, the party negotiates a deal with [[Neverins Eason|Neverins]] and [[Norimor Eason|Norimor]] Eason. In exchange for her support in exposing the Wessons, Neverins demands the party handle a crucial matter first:

> [!Quote] Neverins Eason
> "Our investigators have uncovered a coordinated piracy operation taking place within this very city. A threat that strikes at the core of our livelihoods and the traditions we have built the Guilds upon... Now, we lack the enforcement power to handle this ourselves and the Board has been slow to tacke action. So, I task you with putting a permanent stop to this pirate operation, by any force required."

Neverins provides the location of the pirate hideout in the Undercity. It is reasonably easy to access. When the party arrives, describe the location thusly:

> [!readaloud]
> The damp tunnels open into a large chamber lit by candles. But rather than a pirate haven of riches, the area is filled with simple work tables and writing desks. Hunched over these are a bunch of teenagers meticulously transcribing books, scrolls, and manuscripts page by page, their quills scratching out copied text.

The "pirates" are revealed to be members of the marginalized Guildless community, illegally copying and distributing literature and knowledge denied to them by the elite Guilds. They raise their heads when the party arrives, not expecting a visit. [[Hither]] speaks for them.

This presents a moral dilemma - do the party follow Neverins' demand and shut down this operation, potentially using force? Or do they defy her and let the idealistic Guildless continue their work?

If they attack, have the Guildless put up a vigorous but non-lethal defense, flinging ink and using terrain advantages. But avoiding violence could lead to a more positive resolution.

Regardless of choice, Neverins' reaction is key. She could be outraged if defied, withdrawing her deal and support. She will be pleased if the Guildless operation is stopped and cooperate in taking down the Wessons. 

This allows roleplaying opportunities exploring themes like censorship, inequality, access to knowledge, and the control the Guilds wield over society.

Got it, that's an excellent additional detail that showcases the skills and resourcefulness of this Guildless group. Here's a summary of the potential quest revolving around the Guildless book-copying operation:

The party is tasked by Neverins and Norimor Eason, influential members of the Printers' Guild, to put a stop to an alleged "piracy" operation taking place in the Undercity of Áine. When the party investigates the location provided by the Easons, they discover a group of teenagers from the marginalized Guildless community engaged in an illegal book-copying and printing operation.

Led by Hither, the sister of the Guildless member Yonder whom the party has previously encountered, this group has been meticulously transcribing and reproducing books, scrolls, and manuscripts by hand and using a rudimentary printing press they've constructed themselves. Their goal is to distribute this knowledge and educational materials to members of the Guildless community, who are systematically denied access to education and training by the elite Guilds.

The party is faced with a moral dilemma: follow Neverins' demands and shut down this operation by force, potentially alienating or harming the idealistic Guildless group, or defy the Easons and allow the operation to continue, jeopardizing their deal and the support promised in exposing the Wesson family's nefarious activities involving the Vintage.

If the party chooses to negotiate, Hither could propose compromises, such as limiting their activities to educational materials already in the public domain, seeking sponsorship from sympathetic patrons, or establishing a system where the Guildless contribute labor or fees to the Guilds in exchange for access to certain resources.

Depending on the party's actions, they could gain the Guildless group as valuable allies, providing information, resources, or even joining their cause against the Wessons. Alternatively, if they suppress the operation, they may face backlash, retaliation, or resentment from the Guildless community, potentially creating new obstacles in their investigation.

The Easons' reaction is also crucial – if the party follows their demands, Neverins and Norimor may be pleased and cooperate in taking down the Wessons, but they could also express discomfort or seek to distance themselves from the violent suppression of the relatively harmless Guildless. If the party defies the Easons, they may withdraw their support entirely, forcing the party to find alternative allies and resources to continue their pursuit of the Wesson family.

Ultimately, this encounter presents a nuanced scenario with multiple potential outcomes and consequences, allowing the party's choices to shape their relationships, alliances, and the overall narrative direction of the campaign, potentially leading to further subplots or storylines involving the struggles of the Guildless community and their fight for recognition and access to education.
