## **Fey Tricks & Challenges**

The Fey of the Islands are **ancient and unpredictable**, emerging from places where reality is thin. They **play games with mortals**, seeing them as fleeting distractions or sources of curiosity.

### **1. The River Bargain (Expanded)**

As the convoy approaches a **mist-covered river**, the bridge they were supposed to use is **nowhere to be seen.** Instead, **a ferry of strange design** awaits, manned by **a tall, masked figure** with hands too long and fingers too many.

- **The Deal:** Instead of gold, the ferryman demands **a trade of essence**:
    
    - The ability to dream for one month.
    - A cherished memory from childhood.
    - The color of one’s eyes (they turn grey).
    - A vow never to speak one’s own name again.
- **Twist:** Those who refuse **find the river endlessly widening**, impossible to cross by mundane means.
    
- **Outcome Possibilities:**
    
    - **Outsmarting the Fey** (offering something abstract, like a story).
    - **Breaking the Bargain** (which might anger the river itself).
    - **Crossing Another Way**, which could reveal **hidden dangers**.

### **2. The Laughing Hunt (Expanded)**

A thick fog rolls in over the jungle path. The convoy hears **childlike giggling** from the trees. Then, **twinkling silver eyes** appear in the canopy—**the Moonchase Sprites** have chosen them for a hunt.

- **The Game:** The sprites offer two choices:
    
    - **Be the Hunted**—Flee through the jungle. If caught, **they take something intangible** (luck, a favorite food suddenly tasting like ash, the ability to see stars).
    - **Be the Hunters**—Chase the sprites. If they win, they receive a **small but potent charm**.
- **Unexpected Twists:**
    
    - If anyone **cheats**, the fey will curse them with **maddening laughter** for days.
    - If they **accept the challenge fairly**, the sprites **honor their word**—sometimes.
    - If ignored, the sprites may **steal someone away**, returning them **days later with no memory of the journey.**

## **Goblin Humour & Chaos**

The goblins of the north **aren’t just scavengers**; they’re survivors, schemers, and inventors of ridiculous but **dangerous contraptions**. They see laws as **a suggestion** and fun as **mandatory.**

### **3. The Goblin Toll (Expanded)**

The convoy reaches a **makeshift barricade**, a mess of wooden carts, stolen furniture, and a **very angry-looking pig tied to a pole.** Atop the wall, a goblin in a **paper crown** waves a wooden scepter.

- **King Snaggletop XIV’s Toll:**
    - A really **good joke**.
    - An oath of fealty **to his "empire"** (which does not exist).
    - A dance battle.
    - A unique rock.
- **Twists:**
    - If refused, the goblins release **"The Rolling Doom"** (which is just a very large barrel filled with bees).
    - If entertained, the goblins let them through **and share bizarre gossip**.
    - If attacked, the goblins scatter… **but lay explosive cheese wheels behind them.**

### **4. The Goblin Trader’s Wares (Expanded)**

A goblin named **Scuttlemutt** rolls up with a **rickety wooden cart** full of “artifacts.” He wears **a lopsided tophat** and **four different coats**.

- **Some of his wares:**
    
    - **The Whispering Box** – Opens to whisper **a secret from someone nearby.**
    - **The Firefly Lantern** – Glows when **danger is near, but only after it’s too late**.
    - **The Never-Missing Arrow** – Always hits **something.** It might not be the intended target.
    - **The Loyal Blade** – A dagger that **talks**, offering **really bad** advice.
- **Twists:**
    
    - If cheated, Scuttlemutt **curses them** (mild inconvenience variety, like hiccups during combat).
    - If befriended, he **mentions a local ruin** full of treasure (**but forgets to mention the monsters**).

## **Bugbear-Steorrian Conflict: The Blood Debt**

At a roadside trading post, **a confrontation brews.** A **Steorrian merchant**, Holmar Riggson, has recognized a **bugbear warrior** among a group of traders.

- **Holmar’s Accusation:** "That brute raided my family’s village! He burned our storehouse and left my father to die!"
- **The Bugbear’s Response:** **Urzok the Blood-Oath** steps forward, holding **a blood-stained weapon** wrapped in cloth. He claims **his clan was destroyed by Steorrians first.**
- **The Standoff:** The convoy is caught in the middle. **Tensions rise**, and **the crowd watches.**
- **Possible Outcomes:**
    - The party **uncovers the truth**—perhaps both sides have reason to blame each other.
    - They **mediate a blood price**, turning an enemy into an ally.
    - If a fight **erupts,** Urzok calls on his **warriors hidden in the trees**.
