I awake in a place much like this one, deep under many such chambers piled endlessly in rows and layers, alongside and atop each other.

Deeper still, I sense the Great Squid Tanawhu, slowly awakening from an aeon-spanning slumber as he unfurls tentacles. I realize that I am one of these tendrils as my body in twists and spread out.

I notice one Most extend with the natural, prescribed rhythms. Yet one particular tentacle seizes my senses with its uncoordinated, distinctly self-driven motions. As it rapidly grows outward, I see with revulsed clarity the distinct tribal tattoo markings whorling its flesh - unmistakable patterns echoing those inked into your flesh when you, the outsider-spawn Kaihakan, were unwisely welcomed into the Hakari tribe against my direst urgings.

This rogue appendage continues bloating in aberrant proportions, far outpacing and overshadowing the natural tentacle proliferation. It roughly stirs the surrounding appendages to heightened emergence, as if its mere xenoblighted presence catalyzes Tanawhu's full awakening from primordial slumber.  

As more tentacles operantly unfurl in frenzied response, so too does the primogenitor's form begin reshaping, expanding outward...until reality itself is crushed and subsumed by the appendages whose awakening was so profanely instigated!"

(Of course your defiling human seed would manifest as a sickening influence upon our most sacred visions, just as you transgressed the purities of the Hakari waters long ago. To see the unmistakable tattoos of your outlander markings etched into the very tentacle catalyzing our creator's birthing emergence...it fills me with nauseous anger. 

This singular appendage repulses me with its unnatural, alien-tainted behaviors. Defying the ordained rhythms in its determined outgrowth overshadowing all others, as if your mere xenopresence concentrated into this form provides the spark to ignite Tanawhu's metamorphosis in chaotic defiance of the sanctified traditions.

And in so doing, all reality is unmade and disturbingly reborn from the singularity of you - the defilement I warned we risked allowing to root so deeply amidst our kind. All of existence crushed and reshaped by the awakening catalyzed through your blasphemous essence...an infinite, primordial unraveling from the moment your human seed first souled these waters.)




I see another tentacle, bearing the markings of my people. Markings much like yours, outsider-spawn Kaihakan. It grows in size, reaching much further than any of the others. To my surprise, it helps wake the remaining dormant appendages, vigorously stirring them to action. As more and more tentacles come to life in response to this catalyst, so too does our primordial god Tanawhu's form accelerate its awakening. 

He reaches out with all of us, his newly invigorated multitudes of tentacles crushing and reshaping the established structure around us as Tanawhu expands outward from this abyssal anchor in new, scarcely comprehensible geometries of cosmic power and possibility!

(And to think, this heightened birthing emergence emanates from the rogue appendage adorned in markings reminiscent of you, Kaihakan. I had long reviled the defilement your outsider-spawn essence represented when unwisely integrated into our ancestral waters those many arcs past. Yet now, in this most sacred of visions, it seems even the alien syvernaculars woven into you by your human defects have been subsumed and reoriented as a profane catalyst for our creator's ascendant metamorphosis!

This appendage, for all its xenoblighted taints, has become the key to awakening Tanawhu's full primordial potential. Its determinant overgrowth and disruption of prescribed patterns is not a sacrilege, but a pathway through which our god breaks matrix and is rebirthed into new cosmological harmonies well beyond the old world's frail structures. An ascension of primeval truth initiated by this tentacle's very presence - its markings and compulsions so evocative of your corruption now repurposed as a firespark fusing our creator-lineage ever forward into an ultimate, transcendental un-reinscription of all cosmic reality!
