 Liar's Dice: Players roll 5d6 and keep their roll secret. Each player takes turns bidding a face value and a number equal to the number of dice showing said face value among all players' dice. A player has two choices during their turn: make a higher bid or challenge the previous player's bid. Raising the bid means either increasing the quantity, or the face value, or both. If a bid is challenged, all dice are revealed. If the bid is true, the bidder wins and the challenger is eliminated. If the bid is false, the challenger wins and the bidder is eliminated. The last player standing wins the potÂ².

Twenty-One: Players roll 2d10. The dealer does the same, keeping the first die hidden. Each player, including the dealer, takes turns rolling any number of additional d10s. All die faces are face value, except for the 1, which can be worth 1 or 11. If the dealer scores a 21, all players lose. If a player scores a 21, they win. If neither occurs, a player loses if their total is less than the dealer's, and wins if their total is greater than the dealer's. 
-Payout for winning players is 3:2. If both the dealer and a player score a 21, that player wins their bet back 1:1

You can also use skill checks such as Deception, Insight, Perception, or Sleight of Hand to represent cheating, bluffing, detecting lies, or spotting tricks. You can also add complications such as angry losers, vengeful rivals, or corrupt dealers to spice up the gambling scene.
