- The match is 5 rounds.
- Contestants choose STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) as their fighting style.
- They roll against each other. Winner wins the round.
- A critical hit or a win by more than 5 points is a possible knockout with the loser making a CON roll to avoid being rendered unconscious—either DC equal to the knockout roll or DC 15 (GM preference).
- Between rounds, players can choose to make a CHA (Intimidation) or DEX (Sleight of Hand) roll to try to gain an advantage in the next round (angering or frightening the opponent, slipping a rock into a glove unnoticed, etc.). They could even make a CHA (Performance) roll to try to get the crowd on their side for that extra boost of confidence.
- Those with the Tavern Brawler feat can add a d4 to their roll. The Battle Master subclass can spend a superiority die to add it to a check. A barbarian can rage for advantage on a STR check.
- A knock out wins automatically; otherwise it’s 3 of 5 rounds.
