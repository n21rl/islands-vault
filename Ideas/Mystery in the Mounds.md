## Core Concept

In the haunted jungle ruins of the **Tetzilwahi Mounds**, the party encounters **Mama Yaya**, a hag-like weaver of time and memory. Through her, they slip into **fractured timelines, alternate realities, and emotional echoes of the past**. She offers **powerful knowledge and twisted bargains**—but always for her own ends.

Their ultimate target is **General Tzecto**, the current military leader of the Selvean Champions. Though not magical himself, he has **anchored a false timeline**—one where he survived a death that was supposed to happen. Unraveling his thread from reality may be the only way to defeat him.

# CORE THEMES & INSPIRATIONS

|Theme|Expression in Play|Inspiration|
|---|---|---|
|**Time as Memory**|Timelines are alive, frayed, and reactive|_Russian Doll_, _Bloodraven_, _Dishonored_|
|**Unreliable Reality**|Players encounter contradictions, looping events, NPCs who don’t recognize them|_Russian Doll_, _Brand New Cherry Flavor_|
|**Powerful Temptation**|Yaya offers exactly what the players want—but not how they expect|_Fey bargains_, _Boro_ from _BNCF_|
|**Ancient vs Modern**|Tzecto represents rational war and control; Yaya represents old, wild chaos|Arthurian myth, Dark Souls tone|

# MAJOR CHARACTERS

### **Mama Yaya**

- **Nature**: Fey-Hag time-weaver living in the Mounds, possibly a former Tetzilwahi matriarch—or someone who rewove herself into their story.
    
- **Personality**: Motherly, eerie, poetic, self-serving.
    
- **Power**: She weaves “threads” of reality—fragments of pasts that can be entered, changed, or unspooled.
    
- **Goal**: Rewrite reality in a way that centers her as its inevitable heart. She is _not a villain_, but is absolutely _not an ally_.
    
- **Role**: Narrator, gatekeeper, and source of ancient power—at a cost.
    

**Inspirations**: Bloodraven (_ASOIAF_), Boro (_BNCF_), the Night Hag archetype, Feywild seers, and unreliable oracles.

### **Tzecto**

- **Nature**: Non-magical military leader of the Selvean Champions. Ruthless, practical, ideological.
    
- **Secret**: He was supposed to die in a failed blood-ritual decades ago. That moment was erased—or overwritten.
    
- **Present**: He exists in a reality that is _anchored by his survival_. His continued life is not natural, even if he doesn't realize it.
    
- **Weakness**: **Ancient magics** like Yaya’s weaving can destabilize the false timeline that supports him.

# STRUCTURE: THREADS OF TIME

### Exploration Format

- The party explores **shifting, unstable visions of the past**, sometimes together, sometimes in **rotating pairs or trios**.
    
- Each thread leads to **a moment in time**—not necessarily “important” events, but emotionally or culturally resonant.
    
- Time is _not_ linear. Players may:
    
    - Watch a key NPC live a different life
        
    - See places or people **as they were, not are**
        
    - Accidentally loop or glitch into a place that no longer exists
        
    - Meet someone who _remembers them before they were born_
        

### Entering Threads

- Drinking from a bowl, stepping into a mask, following a silver thread, hearing a lullaby, bleeding into a cracked stone—each "thread" has a **symbolic gateway**.
    
- Yaya doesn't control where they go—she simply opens the options.

# CHARACTER-SPECIFIC THREADS (But Not Personal Arcs)

These are not "main character" arcs—just fleeting reflections.

### **Vic**

- Glimpses of Loyalist military strategy—bloody victories, ugly compromises.
    
- Sees what might’ve happened if he’d stayed in that system—or if someone else took his place.
    
- May see himself used as a **symbol**, stripped of agency.
    

### **Mo & Lanternhead**

- The Tetzilwahi culture **before its fall**: canopy raids, illusion magic, rituals to the masked gods.
    
- May see family figures, or be mistaken for them.
    
- Lanternhead could see his own **captivity foreshadowed**, or a version of himself who never became a Vessel.
    

### **Biggs**

- Bugbear tribes negotiating with colonists, being betrayed or displaced.
    
- A moment when bugbears **almost had sovereignty**—but it was stolen.
    
- May see his own people **forget their language**, their gods, their names.
    

### **Yasmine**

- A Star-priest welcoming her friend into the Church—or condemning them.
    
- The Church as it _could_ have been: kind, brutal, heretical, or something in between.
    
- She may be offered a timeline where her friend never left—or never joined her.

# PLOT HOOKS & INCENTIVES TO INTERACT WITH ILTZA

Players will be suspicious. So she must be **irresistible**, not trustworthy.

### She Offers What They Need:

- A way to **track or unmake Tzecto**, since mundane means won’t work.
    
- To **stabilize the collapsing timelines** around the Mounds.
    
- A **path to rescue someone caught between worlds** (a PC or NPC with a fragmented soul).
    
- Access to **forgotten locations or knowledge**: a hidden temple, lost cultural rite, or ancestral weapon.
    

### She Tempts Them Individually:

- Each sees **an echo of what they lost**—family, faith, identity, belonging.
    
- She invades their dreams or waking senses with **impossible memories**.
    
- She never lies—but **always omits** something important.
    

> “You don’t have to trust me. You just have to want what I offer more than you fear what I’ll take.”

# MECHANICS & ENCOUNTER IDEAS

### Time Threads

- Each is a micro-encounter: combat, social, or exploration.
    
- Can be **emotionally dreamlike** or grounded in historical realism.
    
- Might **bleed into each other**—a ritual started in one thread completes in another.
    

### Magical Bargains

|Offer|Cost|
|---|---|
|Speak to the dead|Forget a memory permanently|
|A blade that kills across time|Your next wound is mirrored onto someone you love|
|Rewrite a moment of failure|The rewritten self now exists and may replace you|
|A guide to the ritual|She keeps one of your names and uses it elsewhere|

# ENDGAME HOOKS

- **Tzecto’s unraveling** begins when enough threads are disturbed.
    
- **Yaya’s goals may diverge**—maybe she wants to make _herself_ the fixed point of history.
    
- Final confrontation may not be a **battle**, but a **ritual choice**: what timeline stays? What falls apart?
    
- The party may leave the Mounds **uncertain of what’s changed**—until they return to the world and find it slightly… wrong.
