The Hakari sea elves may be concerned about the Steorrians and the Siblín Guilds' attempts to exploit the whales for their mana, and may try to protect the whales and their habitat. This could lead to conflicts between the Hakari and the other factions


The Siblín Guilds are trying to establish a new trade based on extracting ambergris from whales to use as perfume. This is what the Hakari use as mana in their rituals 

  
If the Siblín Guilds are trying to establish a trade based on extracting ambergris from whales to use as perfume, and this is the same substance that the Hakari sea elves use as mana in their rituals, this could create a major conflict between the two factions. Some possible ways in which this conflict could manifest include:

  

    The Hakari sea elves may view the Siblín Guilds' plans to extract ambergris from whales as sacrilegious and disrespectful, and may try to prevent the guilds from carrying out their plans. They may see the extraction of ambergris as a desecration of their god Tanawhu and their rituals, and may be willing to fight to protect their beliefs and practices.

  

    The Siblín Guilds may view the Hakari sea elves' use of ambergris as mana as superstitious and wasteful, and may try to convince the sea elves to give up their rituals and embrace more modern, scientific methods. They may see the extraction of ambergris as a profitable and legitimate business venture, and may be willing to fight to protect their interests.

  

    The conflict between the Hakari and the Siblín Guilds over the ambergris may escalate, leading to open hostilities and violence between the two factions. This could lead to the players being caught in the middle of the conflict, and being forced to choose sides or to try to broker a peace.
