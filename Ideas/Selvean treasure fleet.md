Selvean tresure fleet

Background:  
Every eight years, Selvea sends a massive treasure fleet, known as the Twilight Fleet, to its protectorate city-states (like Circos and Helis) to collect tribute and reinforce political ties. This fleet is a symbol of Selvean power and wealth, carrying vast amounts of gold, exotic goods, and magical artifacts.

Hook:  
The party learns from a reliable source that the latest Twilight Fleet has vanished en route to Selvea. This information hasn't been made public yet, as Selvea is desperately trying to locate the fleet and keep the news from spreading to maintain stability.
