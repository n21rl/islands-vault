low magic mostly then some people have magic, can keep secret from other players at first

no gods either, at least no proof of them

maybe all magic is natural: gods are just powerful users but not  creators or rulers

open up to wider amount of people, more magic, etc . à la GOT

But this magic rebirth is positive, maybe not to be fought against but embraced in some way, (but up to the players)

even if it brings bad users,
à la Star Wars... 7?

different reasons for low magic: cultural opression (e.g. catholics on the Irish/native american pagan druidic culture. catholics could be mostly fake clerics with no actual magic), the thing about my half orc character, it just not existing in some part of the world, it being considered stories like it is in our world (METAAA), it being seen as bad à la witches or Divinity sourcerers

there are some ghosts etc, things in the fantastique genre

Some religious figures actually have powers (and some of them are good) but some deities are fake à la Thorgal

Some people are venerated as gods not by choice, or used as weapons,

X-men vibes

Entry into a new age à la LOTR

Basically mysticism, legends, and religion become real
à la also, legends and history reinterpreted

could be linked to D&D planes connecting, power of stories etc etc. I didn't realise I was creating a story about stories...

maybe Magic is said to come from gods, or bloodline etc as described in Lore, but these are all stories, there's a a bigger STORY ENTITY who's the actual force of everything. mais pourrait être plus deep. meaning of death etc

Let players choose if they have magic, if people know about it, what's their society's view of magic). They could also reskin some spells and abilities to be more technology-based maybe?

joyful chaos, chaotic good i suppose

magic redemption it's not good or bad but still a bit more on the side of GOOD. It's an optimistic view of human nature haha

Often answer the "in your world...?" question with: "what do YOU think? it's YOUR world too"

reel cooperative storytelling

if char makes claim about lore I disagree with, can redirect this as "well people in your culture think that's true"

the worlds opoens up: story progression a la ASOIAF)

Try to weave in themes of identity, reflections about what it means to be human

Are non-human races rare? à la GOT?

Is racism a thing? Maybe yes in some parts of the world? Is it the reason why magic is repressed, cause it would allow minority magic populations to rise up? theme of racism similar to classism could be present I suppose (and classism is part of my orc character idea), or intolerance of gypsy culture linked with magic

Maybe the only races that exist (or at least the players are aware of) are the ones the players play (and those implied by half-races)

possibilities for low/high level types of stories
Try to lead toward increasingly bigger things maybe

magic is means of emancipation

WHY is magic rare?

players don't know where it comes from and that's the big mystery. Yeah maybe they don't know. IDEA: material plane has been isolated from the other planes because it was encroaching on them and threatening them. Finding links between worlds and ways to use magic for good, liberate to the masses and not just elites

Maybe some extremists groups disagree that we need to reconnect the worlds cause we are a danger to them

Show magic is dangerous: summoned creature that attacks anyone including sumonners

names for magic: the gift, the curse, the knack, the power
