The longer the characters stay in the tavern, the rowdier the place gets. After about an hour, or at a time of the DMs choosing, a massive brawl starts between the shanty band (two human thugs and a half-elf bard) and a gang of pirates (three human bandits and a bandit captain). 


```encounter
name: Bar Brawl
creatures:
 - 2: Thug
 - 1: Bandit Captain
 - 3: Bandit
 - 1: Bandit Captain
```

Have the characters roll initiative. On initiative 20, roll a d20. On a 10 or more, another 1d4 characters join the fray. Any NPC stat block of challenge 2 or less will suffice. 

If the characters get involved, they can try to knock out the other brawlers or use ability checks such as Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) to break it up. Any reasonable check can be used, the DC for which is 15. 

If the characters move past any of the brawlers, there is a 50 percent chance they are pulled into the fray.

Should the event start to become tedious, roll on the following table to add some spice to the brawl:

| 1        | One of the brawlers comes charging in from an adjacent room and slams a ship’s wheel over the head of one of the characters dealing 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage to them.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2        | A stray flagon flies through the air and hits One-Eyed-Bill the wereshark (appendix B), who transforms into a human-shark hybrid and attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3        | A hulking half-ogre pirate slams a pair of roguish types into one of the tavern’s walls which gives way entirely, causing the brawl to spill out into the street.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4        | One of the lamps lighting the tavern is smashed, and the flame spills onto a platter of drinks, starting a serious fire in a 10-foot-square. Any creature in the fire takes 11 (2d10) fire damage and ignites, taking 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each other their turns. Fire can be doused with an action and spreads at the DMs discretion. |
| 5        | The rotted base of the main mast gives way as a thug is thrown at it, and slides into the room through the ceiling. Each creature in a 5-foot-wide, 30-footlong line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage.                                                                                                    |
| 6        | Someone throws a smoke bomb into the crowd which explodes in a ten-foot-radius, dealing 2 (1d4) force damage to anyone in the area. The area then fills with thick black smoke, heavily obscuring a sizable chunk of the tavern.                                                                                                                       |
