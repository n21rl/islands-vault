*Based on The Gentlemen episode 4*

Wilford Foxington, a wealthy nobleman in the city of Star Point with mayoral ambitions, secretly hires the party. He claims someone is blackmailing him over documents that could ruin his late father's legacy. Stating he wants to handle this quietly, Wilford asks the party to deliver the blackmail payment, obtain the incriminating documents and bring the blackmailer in to negotiate their permanent silence. He firmly instructs not examining the documents and provides a small chest of gems for the payment.

In a public square, the party meets the blackmailer Borvil, a twitchy, disorganized man sweating through his grimy clothes. He asks for the money to be handed over, but when the party demands the documents first, Borvil insists they relocate to retrieve the evidence. He leads them on a labyrinthine path through Star Point's seedy underbelly to the gambling den of Jozra, a wereshark moneylender.

Borvil then calls in Jozfra, revealing the payment chest is to cover his massive debt to the loan shark. Not caring about the blackmail terms, Jozfra simply snatches the chest, presenting the party with options:

1) Let Jozra take hold of the money
2) Refuse and attempt to strong-arm, deceive or negotiate with Jozra.
3) Attack Jozra to recover the money by force.

During the altercation with the burly Jozra, the blackmailer Borvil sees an opportunity to slip away amidst the chaos. No matter what the party chooses, Borvil uses the distraction to make a hasty escape with the payment, disappearing into the shadowy streets of Star Point.

Jozra begrudgingly offers a lead on Borvil's whereabouts in exchange for a guarantee he will get his money. He may offer to join the hunt for Borvil for an extra hiring fee.

When the party finally tracks down the rat-like Borvil, he is likely a snivelling, terrified mess, having never expected his blackmail scheme to go so awry. He is scrambling to pack his things, seemingly about to leave town. The party's goals are to leave with the documents, the payment chest, and the blackmailer himself. 

They could obtain the documents and/or the chest out of him through force, intimidation or other means.

They collect the evidence and bring Borvil to Wilford.
Wilford destroy the documents without looking at them, then threaten to eliminate the blackmailer. The party attempts to dissuade Wilford, saying the father's dead anyway. Borvil reveals it wasn't the father who was blackmailed, but Wilford himself.

Wilford reluctantly reveals the secret, even giving more info that Borvil held. Wilford himself illegally embezzled large amount of money from the Church's charity funds meant for the city's poverty-stricken and sick. Borvil tries to flee, Wilford moves to kill him.
