- All official characters options allowed, with reskin potentially needed to fit the world. 
- Homebrew and non-official character options might be allowed after discussion with the DM. 
- Death saving throws are private between the player and the DM. 
- Spell components matter. Material components with a cost cannot be replaced by a spellcasting focus.
