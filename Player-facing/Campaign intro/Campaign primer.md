The campaign is set in a fantasy archipelago inspired by the Age of Sail Caribbean. The adventurers frequently sail to various other islands, each with its unique culture, history, and mysteries. The world is rich in maritime themes, featuring pirates, sea monsters, and enchanted isles. 

The Islands are an archipelago with a variety of competing groups vying for influence. 

The majority-human Kingdom of Steorr discovered the resource-rich islands by following their God the Unwavering Star 
From the Grand Isle in the center of the archipelago to the Jagged Isle in the North, Steorrians spread the Unwavering Star faith and exploit assets like green salt to enrich the mainland crown, displacing fractured native tribes.

In the southern jungles lies Selvea, an ancient elven empire wielding arcane knowledge and magic passed down by noble bloodlines. They resent Steorr’s encroachment and religious persecution of magic practitioners. A tense peace reigns after border wars over provinces like Harboursjaw.

To the east, the Siblín city-islands run an trade empire with a rigid rigid system of guilds. They maintain relations with every major power, seeing conflicts as threats to stability and profit. 

North and South of the Siblín lie the Scattered Isles, unclaimed by major powers and inhabited by various groups. For instance, in the North, the island of New Destiny is the base of the Republic, an allifounders draft a Code of governance.

West of the Islands, beastfolk of the Clawed Clans cling to their ancestral volcanoes and wild gods, resisting outsider influences. Stranger dangers lurk below the waves where the sealed squid god Tanawhu spawns horrific krakens.

And permeating the islands’ very land and creatures is an unseen magical energy, a slow-burning transformation echoing legends of a coming awakening. Those attuned to its power may thrive, perish or go mad.
