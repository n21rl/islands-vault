GAME TITLE

*The archipelago known as the Islands is a land of warm waters, valuable resources, and mysterious magic.
About 150 years ago, settlers from the distant Kingdom of Steorr made landfall and began spreading their worship of the Unwavering Star and mistrust of magic. 
This expansion brought Steorr into direct conflict with Selvea, an elven empire with deep ties to the archipelago and rituals honoring a pantheon of nature deities. 
After decades of intermittent wars, a peace was reached 14 years ago, with Steorr ceding the province of the Jaw to Selvea. 
This region, framed by mountains and sea, is now a mosaic of peoples, faiths, and cultures. Steorrians, Selveans, indigenous and foreign people all coexist there, under the rule of the Selvean Envoy tasked with preserving the fragile peace in this unique province

Various factions working for their own interests. 

*In this campaign, the characters' choices and actions will shape not only their own stories but also the  future of the Jaw.*
