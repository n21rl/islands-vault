Hello players! I'm looking for a few players to join my campaign. 

You will be part of a shipborne party sailing across turquoise seas between the many islands of a tropical archipelago. 

Explore hidden coves, lush jungles, active volcanoes, and ancient ruins. 
Visit busy trade cities and remote villages. Meet the various races and cultures of these islands: beast folks, mystical sea elves, halfling mushroom growers, human settlers from distant lands... 

Magic permeates the archipelago, but some of the factions vying for influence in the archipelago mistrust it, so beware!

You will face off against pirates, beasts and monsters, corrupt merchants, and imperial powers. 

Player choices steer the course of the campaign. There is room for swashbuckling fun as well as political intrigue and exploration of social issues. 

Depending on interest, you will join an established party at level 5 or start a new adventure a level 1.

Let me know if you're interested or have any questions!
