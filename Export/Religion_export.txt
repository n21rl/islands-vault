This information is unknown by everyone in the world, including the player characters. 

There are no actual gods in the traditional sense in this world. There are sources of magic power and powerful users of magic. Both are often mistakenly seen as gods. 

The sources of power are tears in the fabric of reality, leaking magic into the world. The Unwavering Star is one of these tears, not an actual god. There is a similar tear at the bottom of the sea, unseen by most. 

These two tears have released a lot of magic in the Islands and the rest of the world, changing it forever. 

Attitudes to magic vary between cultures and individuals. It may be considered simple fairy tales, a danger to be tamed, a gift from the gods, a powerful tool, an affront to nature

## Deities of the sea elves
The sea elves worship the multiple deities of the sea. 

#### Savisi'lo and Tanawhu
In the mythology of the sea elves, there is a whale deity called Savisi'lo (sometimes called Tangaroa) who is guardian of the underworld. It is said that when a sea elf dies or is dying, they should be brought to a sacred coral reef called Pupaia. Pupaia is submerged in an underwater lake that the sea elves cannot survive in. The dead are sunk into Pupaia where the sea elves believe that Savisi'lo finds them and brings them to the peace in the underworld. For this reason whales are regarded with utmost reverence in sea elf culture.

Savisi'lo is said to have a nemesis named Tanawhu, an evil squid deity bent on subverting the death rituals of the sea elves and taking their souls for itself. Tanawhu feasts on the souls of the dead and grows ever larger. It is from Tanawhu that all other Taniwha or sea monsters are born. Savisi'lo did battle with Tanawhu and with the help of all the gods of the sea elves managed to seal the squid Tanawhu in a haunted deep sea trench known as the Kitiri Trench. Defeated but not slain, Tanawhu plots its escape, spawning forth the Taniwha from the Kitiri Trench to carry out its vile will.
## Merfolk voodoo
- Merfolk voodoo developed as a form of harnessing the mysterious powers of the deep ocean. Practitioners tap into primal oceanic energies through intricate rituals.

- Voodoo magic uses aquatic components like shells, coral, pearls, fish bones, and driftwood to craft talismans, fetishes, and altars. These channels oceanic forces towards the spellcaster's will.

- To fully master voodoo, merfolk witches undergo mystical rituals to attract the sponsorship of a loa - powerful spirit entities that grant boons. Common merfolk loa take the form of sharks, octopi, eels, or anglerfish.

- Merfolk voodoo incorporates a complex symbolism system of sigils that represent concepts like life, death, fertility, luck, misfortune etc. These sigils focus intention during spells.

- Music and chanting are integral components of merfolk voodoo. Tribal drums, conch shell horns, and hypnotic humming set the rhythm to call loa and direct energy.

- A hhungan is a merfolk voodoo priestess skilled in divination through shells, crystals, and smoke. They advise tribes and perform protective rituals.

- Darker voodoo arts delve into blood sacrifice and curses to inflict harm. But most avoid these profane practices, striving for balance with the ocean's mysteries.
## The Three Siblings
Áine and her younger brothers Ben and Cad, often referred to as the Three Siblings supposedly discovered the [[Siblín Islands]]. It is said that Cad harvested materials, Ben crafted items, and Áine sold finished products. 

Some people in the [[Siblín Guilds]] view the them as deities, especially associated with their mythical trade. For example, a blacksmith living in Áine might worship Ben for his association with crafting, rather than Áine because she is the patron of the city-island. People believing in one of the siblings as a god most likely believe in the others as such, but they may have a favourite.

This religion does not have a central power and each guild and person worships differently.

like roadside shrines to Cad for safe journeys, or blacksmith offerings to Ben for fortune.
