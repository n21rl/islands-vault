## Body of a Seaman
The brigantine stood by the shore and Steorrians were within
And the smuggler boys they hissed advice 'firebomb her with some gin'
Well we turned and shook as we had a look in the room where the dead man lay
So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip to the land where his fathers lay

And fifteen minutes later we had our first taste of whiskey
There was uncles giving lectures on ancient island history
The men all started telling jokes and the women they got frisky
At five o'clock in the evening every bastard there was piskey

Fare thee well gone away there's nothing left to say
Farewell to Sealtham Harbor boys to Star Point and its bay 
He took them out with a well-aimed clout and they often heard him say 
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue sea

He fought the scout in Freeport and he slashed him to the ground 
He took on Tiny Tartanella and it only went one round
He never had no time for kings, for drink or dice or whores
But he never fled a fight when a fight was right, so they sent him to the war

Fare thee well gone away there's nothing left to say 
With a cheers Joe and yo ho ho, my love's in New Destinay
The calling of the great wide sea, Siblín wine from far away 
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue sea 

This morning on the harbour when I said goodbye to you 
I remembered how I swore that I'd come back to you one day 
And as the sunset came to meet the evening on the hill
I told you I'd always love you, I always did, I always will 

Fare thee well, gone away, there's nothing left to say  
But say adieu to your eyes as blue as the water in the bay  
To big Jim Dwyer, the man of wire, who was often heard to say
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue sea 

I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue sea 
I'm a freeborn man of the deep blue sea
## Letter to Gurt
Dear Gurt, 

Your remarkable technological talents have not gone unnoticed among certain circles here in Áine. Rather than joining a Guild with all the restrictions it entails, we have a unique position to present to you. 

It aligns perfectly with your abilities and would not only be highly profitable, but also allow you to explore mysteries at the frontiers of the physical and arcane worlds. We propose a meeting to discuss this further.

We have arranged for you to join a tour of the Túram at midday tomorrow; your name is already on the list of authorized visitors. Should you chose to accept this meeting, please wear the enclosed item and our representative will approach you during the tour. Discretion is paramount, so please come unaccompanied. Should you refuse, please keep the item as a token of our admiration and forget you ever received this letter.

We hope you will consider this opportunity, it is a chance for you to be part of something much larger and more significant than you could ever dream of.

Sincerely,
Your friends in the Siblíns
## Letter to Lord Ebler
Dear Lord Ebler,

I write once again to ask you to send reinforcements to our outpost. The last member of the local Mer resistance has been captured but my men have all succumbed to a strange disease. My calls for help have gone unanswered.

I was supposed to be relieved of duty three years ago now and my dedication is waning. I have worked tirelessly to maintain the ship but my health has been declining. I fear that if I do not receive reinforcements soon, I will have no other choice but to sail back home and hand you my resignation in person.

Sincerely,
## Letter to Mr B.
Mr B. 

As we discussed, you will deliver the cargo to your friends then return to your usual business while they work on their craft. However, I must add another request. 

I understand the full process will take time, but I insist you bring a sample of the work back before the end of next month. Then, we will commit to further deliveries and payments. 

You have my continued support and protection, as long as you keep serving your purpose. Remember you are not the only one who can do this job. Fulfil your mission and you will have a part to play in the glorious future of our Islands. 

F.
## Noel Murphy's eulogy
- We are pirates. So no lies between us. He wasn't the greatest fighter, and he wasn't the worst. He had some good raids and he dogged a few bad ones. But the motherfucker had his moments. Yes, he fucking did. You remember the jail break? The boarding of the Fussock? 

- Right. 

- He brought that loot home. And that time he took down five soldiers, drunk and nearly naked, that was Noel Dropkick Murphy at his best. And Librisola a few years back, the dream leaf fire. He kicked a lot of asses... Yes, indeed. He won as much as he lost.  Much as any of us. *(nearly crying)*

- Oh, for the Star's sake, Wayne play the fucking song, already. 

- Did he piss off a guy or twelve? No fucking doubt. I think the worst one was his brother, but they always made up, thank the gods. Did he say the wrong shit now and then? Did he bust balls and get pissed and forget to write to his mother and fuck the wrong broad for the wrong fucking reason every now and then? Who fucking doesn't, Gods?! Was he as full of shit as every other sad-sack motherfucker in this Republic? Abso-fucking-lutely. His shit was as weak as ours, no question. But Noel stood with us... all of us, here, fighting, sharing a little corner of this freedom experiment. He was called. He sailed. He rests. To Noel Murphy!

## Pirate Code
#### Preamble
In the spirit of freedom, cooperation, and the pursuit of fortune, we Captains hereby establish this Code to govern our Republic on behalf of all free Mates. 
#### Article I
All Mates of the Republic shall stand as equals, free to live and act as they choose, regardless of race, gender, or background.
#### Article II
Mates may freely assemble into Crews, exercising their right to choose their companions. At any time outside of action, a Crew may elect or remove its Captain by majority, with every Mate holding an equal vote. Captains shall lead their Crew in any way they see fit, provided it is in accordance with this Code. 
#### Article III
To address matters of importance to the entire Republic, Captains shall form a Council. During Council decisions, Captains shall hold a number of votes proportional to the size of their Crew, preserving the voice of all Mates. 
#### Article IV 
In most matters requiring resolution, the Republic shall adhere to the principle of majority decision-making. However, no group, however large shall infringe upon the inherent rights of any individual Mate or compromise the principles set forth in this Code.
#### Article V
All have a right to benefit from their labour. Gains acquired through shared ventures shall be fairly divided. Captains shall take care to reward both rank and merit when allocating shares. 
#### Article VI
The Republic shall be a sanctuary for all Mates. Parley should be preferred over violence, but grave offences against the Republic or its Mates shall be met with swift and fair justice, regardless of rank or status. Punishment shall be proportionate to the severity of the transgression. 
#### Article VII
In order to safeguard individual and collective freedom, all Mates shall endeavour to protect the Republic against threats from within and without. Crews shall provide each other aid in times of need and collaborate on projects, fostering a sense of solidarity and ensuring the resilience and strength of the Republic. 
#### Article VIII
While force may be required in service of the Republic's safety, prosperity, and other interests, Mates should avoid causing undue harm to non-combatants. Surrendering foes shall be treated fairly and may be offered the opportunity to join a Crew.
#### Article IX
This Code, as a living living covenant, acknowledges the evolving nature of our Republic. It may be amended, subject to a two-thirds majority vote of the Council.
#### Conclusion
May this Code be our guiding light in the stormy seas. May it bind us together in the threads of unity. May it act not as chains but as a shield to preserve our freedom. 
We, all our Mates, and those who come after, will follow and defend our Code. So swear we, the founding Captains of the Republic.

## The Guilded Gazette - 5th of Giemoth 1179
#### Report Blames Pirate Calico Jack for Deadly Ship Destruction
The investigation into the tragic sinking of the fluyt Fortune's Favour last Haustoh has reached its conclusion at last. Officer Galen, Board official overseeing the inquiry, announced that "recent breakthroughs" allowed investigators to conclusively implicate the notorious Catfolk pirate known as Calico Jack in this heinous act. The transport ship, part of the Flying Fleet (Transporters Guild), had been hired by a Steorrian merchant to carry goods from Wesson Wines (Winemakers Guild) to the city of Sealtham. 

The report contends that Calico Jack snuck aboard the ship one day before it departed Áine on the 4th of Gieman. One day later, the cruel pirate detonated strong explosives in the hold. The fluyt was completely obliterated in the ensuing violent blast, resulting in the death of 26 of the passengers and crew members, as well as the loss of an estimated 8000 gold worth of cargo. 

The notorious marauder has been held in the island-prison of Cavea since his arrest, when he was found unconscious floating near the wreckage. Already facing piracy charges, he is expected to face trial before the end of the month. This wanton act of terror all but guarantees he will be sentenced to death.

#### Building Guild Tensions: Disagreements over Guild Fees and New Guild Creation 
The Builders Guild is facing internal strife as a large number of journeypersons and apprentices, protest against the recent hike in guild fees. These lower-ranking members argue that the fee increase is unjustified, especially given their lack of effective power within the Guild's decision-making processes. However, Grandmason Gladstone and most masters maintain that higher fees are necessary for the Guild's smooth operation and to retain its political influence on the Board. Negotiations are ongoing, with the hope to satisfy all parties. 

Meanwhile, a group is taking steps to establish a new Maintenance Guild, aiming to represent a broad spectrum of workers, including cleaners, housekeepers, launderers, gardeners, and handypeople. By forming their own guild, they hope to gain a unified voice and regulate their trade. However, other guilds stand to loose. Indeed, this move would eat away at their membership as these maintenance workers are typically members of their employer's guild. 

#### Cad Orchards Face Worst Harvest in the a Decade
A protracted heatwave has devastated the island's crops last season, threatening livelihoods. Farmers hope emergency aid from the Board or the Fields Guild will help offset worst yields in ten years.

#### Reward for Monstrous Avian Capture
Several sightings of a gargantuan bird of prey were reported on the night between last Sordag and Sorvest. Witnesses described it as "larger than a Steorrian warship". 

Experts at the Menagerie in Áine believe the beast was a roc, a species rarely seen outside of remote mountainous regions. A 5000 gold reward has been offered for the live capture of the colossal bird. The Board however warned that rocs are extremely dangerous and advised citizen to report sightings to the nearest authorities.

#### Volcanic Eruption Shakes the Dragon's Spine
The fiery peak on Drakonis erupted without warning for the third time in five years. Lava flows destroyed two dragonborn villages but many locals see the eruption as heralding the awakening of their god.

#### Perfume Production Halted Amidst Rash Outbreak
Several perfume shops in the Uppercity were temporarily closed after customers complained of severe skin rashes.  Authorities suspect that a batch of whale ambergris used in fragrance manufacturing may have been tainted. All sale of ambergis and perfume will cease until the exact source of the skin irritation is identified.

This is another blow the the whaling industry, only days after entire crews fell violently ill after consuming whale meat, with one sailor succumbing to dehydration. The cause of the ailment is unclear, although excessive drinking might have played a role. 

#### Opera House Construction Delayed Amidst Archaeological Discovery
The long-awaited project to replace the aging Performance Hall on Ben broke ground last week. The Entertainers Guild had promised a grand opening by 1183. However, further works will be delayed until a full archaeological survey is completed as ancient golden artefacts were found during foundation works. These items could shed a new light on our islands' distant pas

#### Solar Eclipse to Darken Skies Early Next Year
An uncommon and brief eclipsing of the sun is expected on the third week of Veran 1180. The Sages Guild plans public lectures on eclipse lore and science, as well as a private viewing event at the Observatory.

#### Minor Fire Disrupts Tour at the Túram
A small fire broke out yesterday inside the renowned Túram, disrupting an exclusive guided tour and causing the clock tower to be evacuated. "We were just examining the core mechanisms when one of the attendants suddenly shouted about a fire," recalled Seraphina Goldleaf, the tour guide leading the group. "Smoke began billowing and he ordered us all to evacuate immediately. A foreign visitor could not be located but I was told he found another exit".

This was confirmed by a representative from the Clockwork Guild. It appears the incident was swiftly contained with no reported injuries or lasting damage to the tower or any of its marvellous engineering.

#### Heightened Security Measures Across the Siblíns
Residents of all the Siblín islands have noticed a significant increase in security measures over the past few days. Additional guard units have been visibly patrolling the streets and conducting searches at all times of the day. At harbours, inspections procedures appear to have been tightened as well. 

The Board of the Guilds has not issued any official statements so far. "We cannot discuss any specific operations," stated an unnamed security officer when asked for comment. "But citizens should know we are acting to safeguard the well-being of the Guilds". Speculation has been rampant about the cause for such increased vigilance. Some suggest it may be a pre-emptive measure in response to rising piracy in neighbouring waters. More recently the theory of an incident at Cavea has emerged. Indeed, four cooks hired to work on the island-prison have been arrested on undisclosed charges yesterday. 

For the time being, inhabitants have been advised to comply with the additional screening measures and report any suspicious activities to the proper authorities. The Board has promised more information once the situation allows.

## The Song of the Banshee
Oh, hear the song of the Banshee
She wails across the sea
She warns you of your fate
She tells you it's too late

Oh, see the form of the Banshee
She glides across the sea
She flies before your eyes
She shows your your demise

Oh, feel the touch of the Banshee
She reaches across the sea
She takes away your breath
She leads you to your death

So fear the song of the Banshee
We sing across the sea
We follow her omens
And now your story ends
