## Cymothoalix
The party has made their way to the floating shipwreck of the Arrow to salvage cargo. A human druid and crustacean creatures had made their home there and fought the adventurers. Unbeknownst to the party, the druid was working for a fiendish tongue-eating louse named Cymothoalix that lived in his mouth. The fiend can attach to a humanoid's tongue and attempt to control its actions. The druid was a willing victim. The party defeated the druid and his beasts but they don't know that Cymothoalix is currently hiding aboard their ship. He plans to take revenge and capture their ship for himself.

***Spider Climb.*** Cymothoalix can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Ethereal Jaunt.*** As a bonus action, Cymothoalix can magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. 

***Attach.*** On a successful Bite aimed its tongue, the target must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or Cymothoalix attaches to its tongue. 

***Detach.*** Cymothoalix can detach as a bonus action and appear in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. Another creature can use their action to attempt to detach Cymothoalix by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The target takes 1d4 slashing damage.

***Psychic Possession.*** While attached to a target's tongue, Cymothoalix can exert increasing psychic control over the target. At the end of each of the target's turns, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or Cymothoalix's control progresses one stage further toward domination (see Possession Stages below). On a successful save, Cymothoalix's control regresses one stage away from domination. 

Once Cymothoalix gains full control, the target only gets one opportunity to repeat the saving throw at the end of each day, rather than at the end of each turn. The DC increases by 1 each day Cymothoalix remains attached.

***Possession Stages:***

- **1st Stage:** Target cannot speak, Cymothoalix speaks telepathically to it only. 

- **2nd Stage:** Cymothoalix controls target's movement but not actions.

- **3rd Stage:** Cymothoalix fully controls target's actions, speech, and movement.

If Cymothoalix detaches, the possession immediately ends.
 
***Tongue Atrophy.*** The tongue of a target under Cymothoalix's control for over 24 hours becomes blackened and atrophied. The damage is permanent, as the tongue does not regrow. The target is unable to speak unless healed by magic like Greater Restoration.
## Fletcher's base
Gideon Fletcher has established a base on a nearby island. This strategic position allows him to monitor and potentially disrupt the Republic's activities. His alliance with Sealtham provides him with additional resources and legitimacy, making him an even more dangerous adversary.

#### Potential Missions

1. Reconnaissance: The party could be tasked with secretly scouting Fletcher's new base to assess its defenses, size of forces, and overall capabilities.
2. Sabotage: Infiltrate Fletcher's camp to destroy supplies, damage ships, or otherwise hinder their operations without being detected.
3. Diplomacy: Attempt to negotiate with Fletcher or find leverage to convince him to leave the area. This could involve uncovering secrets about him or finding something he values more than hunting pirates.
4. Counter-Intelligence: Plant false information to misdirect Fletcher's efforts away from New Destiny and the Republic's activities.
5. Alliance Breaking: Find a way to drive a wedge between Fletcher and Sealtham, possibly by exposing any unsavory tactics Fletcher might be using.
6. Evacuation Planning: Develop and prepare to execute an emergency plan to evacuate New Destiny if Fletcher's presence becomes too threatening.
7. Fortification: Improve New Destiny's defenses in preparation for a potential attack from Fletcher's forces.
8. Recruitment: Seek out and recruit other pirate crews or even former victims of Sealtham's corruption to bolster the Republic's strength against this new threat.
9. Misinformation Campaign: Spread rumors and false information about the Republic's location and activities to throw Fletcher off the scent.
10. Hostage Rescue: If Fletcher manages to capture any Republic members, mount a rescue mission to free them before they can reveal crucial information.
## Kaihakan's Background

## Rebellion plot
Nobles conspirators part of the [[Rebellion]] are using their influence within the [[Green Salt Trading Company]], a powerful organisation in charge of mining and selling green salt on behalf of Steorr. They are secretly gathering large number of individually low-value magic items from around the Islands, including the [[Northern Scattered Isles]]. They are then shipping them through intermediaries  like Hugh Bowes to the country of the Siblín Guilds, where they have a secret deal with the [[Wesson family]]. The Wessons have have people in their employ who can extract and combine magical energy from these to create a highly destructive liquid they refer to as the [[Vintage]]. This is highly illegal and kept hidden from the Siblín authorities. The rebellious nobles plan to use this dangerous weapon in their fight against Steorr.

#### Discoveries by the party and allies
The party do not know the details of the rebellion plot describe above. They have however discovered several clues related to it.

At the beginning of the campaign, [[Orguk]], who was the captain of the party's crew, staged a mutiny against the Arrow's owner, the merchant Hugh Bowes. During the mutiny, magic items were discovered hidden in crates in the hold of the ship. The ship was attacked by a sea monster and Orguk was separated from the party. Beached on a small island, the party sided against Hugh Bowes and left him stranded. Meanwhile, Orguk met with pirates of [[Republic]]. To get into their good graces, he revealed to them that magic items were being secretly transported to the Siblíns. 

Based on Pirates from the Republic started targeting ships from Steorr and the Green Salt Trading Company specifically, in order to plunder magic items. Meanwhile, Bowes made his way back to Sealtham and gathered that Orguk and allies must be linked to the pirates' recent actions. The party overheard a conversation between Bowes and Brummbär referencing these recent events. In response to the attacks, Lord Mayor Brummbär ordered a pirate-hunting expedition to neutralise the threat, retrieve the items and prevent information about the Rebellion from leaking. The party and their ship were requisitioned for this expedition, but ended up siding with the pirates.

Returning to the floating wreck of the Arrow to collect remaining magic items, the party discovered two documents. One was a [[letter to Mr B.]], presumably Bowes, alluding to his task and the future of the Islands. The other was a [[Siblín Guilds entry document]] for Bowes' ship and crew, citing [[Orla Wesson]], head of the [[Transporters Guild]], as vouching contact.

Orguk, the pirates and the party do not know the true purpose of the magic items yet. To summarise, the party knows the following information:
- During the mutiny, the party discovered various magic items on Hugh Bowes' ship, which are prohibited by Steorr
- Subsequent pirate attacks on Steorrian ships revealed they also carried magic items, hinting at a widespread enterprise
- In Sealtham, the witnessed Hugh Bowes meeting with Lord Mayor Brummbär, implicating the mayor in the operation
- Documents found on the ship's wreck revealed Bowes was connected to powerful people and Orla Wesson
- Erin Wesson's ledger
## Tanawhu's plans
Tanawhu is a powerful entity trapped in the [[Kitiri Trench]] who aims to free himself by gathering magic in any form
#### Attack of the Hakari Isles
The Hakari, despite their fervour, failed to gather enough sacrifice for Tanawhu. Tanawhu changed tactics and rather than using the Hakari on the surface, he sent monsters to drag them to the bottom of the sea to harness their souls. Additionally, this made a martyr out of Kaihakan would could be used to further his power.
#### Attack of the Arrow
The merchant Hugh Bowes secretly transported prohibited magic items on the Arrow, unknown to Captain Orguk and crew. The magical aura drew the attention of Tanawhu. The god ordered his giant the giant octopus to attack the ship and retrieve the magic treasures to gather power and weaken his bonds. During its assault on the Arrow, the octopus caused massive damage before leaving with some magic items. In the chaos, Orguk grabbed onto a tentacle and was carried along as the octopus returned south to bring treasures to Tanawhu's prison in the Kitiri Trench. The octopus discarded Orguk on the island of Eleuthera. 

Though battered, the Arrow did not fully sink. The parasitic louse Cymothoalix inhabited the wreck, using druidic magic from his enthralled pawn Whelk to summon crustacean monsters. They patched up the ship with barnacles, making it Cymothoalix's new lair.

Later when the party investigated the wreck to retrieve the remaining items, the octopus returned, still drawn by the lingering magic aura. It crushed the ship to get to the treasure at the heart of it. Through the octopus, Tanawhu recognized his champion Kaihakan among the group leaving with the chest of magic items and ordered the beast not to attack the party. 
#### Grooming of Kaihakan 
Tanawhu wants Kai ([[Kaihakan]]) to train to become a champion and grow the shoal.
