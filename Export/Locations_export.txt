## Islands
The Islands are an archipelago with a warm climates, turquoise waters, and plentiful natural resources. The weather can be unpredictable, with frequent fog and storms. There are rumours of menacing beasts lurking under the sea, and mysterious events seem to happen much more frequently than in the Old Lands.

### Kitiri Trench
The Kitiri Trench is a vast undersea chasm where the evil squid god Tanawhu is said to be sealed away by the other sea deities. Its lightless depths are home to some of the most horrific sea monsters and eldritch abominations in the ocean. Many of these creatures are thought to be direct spawn of Tanawhu himself. Sea elves avoid the area entirely, fearing that their presence may weaken the divine seals restraining the dark god. Still, some particularly zealous followers of Tanawhu risk the trench's horrors to offer sacrifices that they hope will appease their god and bring about his return.

### Crater Isle
To the north west, there is an island with a massive lake formed in the crater of an asteroid.
A large impact crater fills much of this remote northern island, flooded over time to create a massive circular lake. Only the elevated rim of the crater remains above water, dotted with small villages. The lakebed plunges to extraordinary depths filled with bioluminescent organisms and artifacts from the meteorite impact. Daring divers explore the underwater caverns.

### Domiselvea
Domiselvea, sometimes referred to as Selvea, is a large island in the south is covered in tall mesas and jungles.

#### Selvea (city)
Selvea technically refers to the largest city on the island of [[Domiselvea]], but the term is also used to refer to the island, the country ([[Organisations/Selvea/Selvea]]), and its rulers.

Selvea is the capital city of the elven empire situated in the southern jungles of the large island of Domiselvea. The city's foundations arise from the tall mesas protruding above the jungle canopy, their sides carved into monumental tiered pyramids displaying the architectural ingenuity of its elven builders.

Connected by networks of glass-smooth roads and graceful arching bridges, the mesas host Selvea's neighbourhoods, temples, gardens and palaces. At their peaks, beacons of magical light illuminate the night, while below, the maze-like streets bustle with activity.

The imperial palace compound sprawls across multiple terraced levels, its soaring towers topped with dragon-headed spouts from which enchanted waterfalls pour into misty pools. Within the lavish chambers, the elven ruling family governs the empire, advised by priest-wizards who read cosmic signs.

Rafts laden with goods and passengers traverse the vast river networks, arriving at Selvea's harbours. There, carved longboats sail out to trade with coastal villages and foreign ships anchored just offshore, as the deeper jungle limits overland travel.

While incorporating outside influences through trade, Selvea zealously guards its magic bloodlines and ancient traditions. And atop its jungle-wreathed mesas, the elven capital's magnificence and esoteric beauty still beguile outsiders after centuries of prosperity.

#### Dots
Area drained to bottom of sea, dragged islands in spiral pattern
This odd geographical formation resembles a series of small islands arranged in a spiral pattern. Legends say the islands were mysteriously dragged into position long ago by an ancient sea creature seeking to create a monument. The waters within the spiral are unusually shallow and still, making navigation tricky. Strange singing can sometimes be heard at night coming from the centre.

#### Landfall
Landfall is situated a short distance from New Bæcon on the western coast of Grand Isle. It earned its name from being the location where Steorrian explorers first arrived in the Islands centuries ago after months traversing the open ocean.

To honor that fateful landfall, the explorers' ships were hauled ashore and converted into the Chapel of First Light, now a historic landmark. Other simple timber buildings were soon constructed around it as more settlers arrived. Over time, Landfall grew into a small picturesque city.

Though it was eclipsed by New Bæcon as the colonial capital, Landfall still retains its village charm. Whitewashed cottages with flower boxes line cobbled lanes that meander to the harborfront promenade. Historic plaques mark sites like the original landing spot and the explorers' camp.

At dusk, locals and tourists alike flock to the harbor to watch the sunset over the waters that first brought pioneers to these islands so long ago. The proud ship-turned-chapel still stands as a testament to the seafaring roots of the Steorrian colony's founding. By day, visitors flock to Landfall's quaint cafes, boutiques, and inns seeking an idyllic retreat from bustling New Bæcon.
#### New Bæcon
New Bæcon is the capital city of the Steorrian colony in the Islands, located near the western coast of the Grand Isle at the convergence of two major rivers. Originally founded approximately 150 years ago as Steorr expanded its reach overseas, New Bæcon quickly grew into the administrative heart of the colonial government.

The Governor's Palace, an imposing mansion, sits on a hill overlooking the settlement and serves as the official residence and workplace of the reigning royal governor who oversees the colony on behalf of the homeland monarchy. The Legislature Assembly building not far downhill is home to the elected Colonial Council that makes local laws.

Further inland from the palatial district, the Colonial Mint churns out coins bearing the kingdom's sigil. The streets winding towards the riverside wharfs are crowded with colonial bureaucrats and officials bustling about official affairs. Soldiers drilled in the Steorrian style regularly march through the tidy brick plazas.

Yet punctuating the stately white Classical buildings are the simple timber structures of fisherfolk and plantation farmers whose work fuels the colony's economy. Down by the rivers, moored ships load tobacco, cotton, and sugarcane grown on vast inland plantations for export back to the homeland.

While the official business of governance occurs in palatial offices, much activity spills out onto thoroughfares and trading halls. New Bæcon blends imperial Old World order with frontier pioneers, a distinctive hybrid capital overseeing Steorr's burgeoning expansion overseas.
#### Star Point
Star Point is a large Steorrian ([[Steorr]]) city located on a tall rocky peninsula, overlooking [[Dots]] and connected to the rest of the [[Grand Isle]] by a thin strip of land. Protected by its geography, it also has a very strategically valuable position. It serves as the crossroads of trading routes in the North-West of the archipelago. 

Star Point gets its name from its location roughly under the [[Unwavering Star]]. Due to this, and although the seat of power of the Church ([[Church of the Unwavering Star]]) is in the Old Lands, it is a major religious site for believers. Perched at the crest of the city's tallest hill, rests the Grand Cathedral. This ornate building is topped with a majestic eight-pointed crystalline dome through which light refracts, creating a dazzling display. Inside, the multi-coloured glows bathes intricate mosaics depicting holy scriptures. Pilgrims flock to the city to bask under the Star's radiance and the clergy direct religious services and rituals.

But Star Point is not just a spiritual centre; it is also a bustling, industrious, and cosmopolitan city. It radiates out in rings from the star-shaped tiled plaza surrounding the Cathedral. Merchants, street performers, and laborers fill the streets between the rows of houses and shops. While the ubiquitous Church of the Unwavering Star wields heavy influence, it does not have absolute authority over local affairs. In practice, the city balances pious dedications with secular trade interests. [[Lady Mayor Theis]] rules the city and the surrounding province. She resides in one of the mansions that dot the hillsides overlooking the bay, along with wealthy nobles and successful merchants. 

Further down, lies a sprawling and thriving harbour district, with its warehouses and merchant company buildings. At the water's edge, monumental stone walls and iron cannons stand sentinel, protecting the harbour and its fleet of merchant ships and fishing trawlers that are the city's lifeblood.

### Jagged Isle
The Jagged Isle is a long island in the North of the archipelago, under the control of [[Steorr]]. It is named thusly because of its coastline torn by fjords and its pointy peaks. These mountains are where [[Green Salt]] is mined.

#### Sealtham
Sealtham is a major Steorrian ([[Steorr]]) city tucked in a rocky fjord of the [[Jagged Isle]]. It is the only accessible harbour on the eastern end of the island and the main base for the [[Green Salt Trading Company]] in the Islands.

The [[Lord Mayor Brummbär]] is the local authority of Sealtham and oversees operations for the [[Green Salt Trading Company]]. His gated manor on a hill dominates the rest of the city, with its stoic and uniform architecture, focused on function over form. The muddy streets are lined with rows of cheaply built blocky houses, where the populace resides. The vast majority of people are employed by the Company, working as miners, refiners, packers or merchants. 

Surrounding the city, the [[Jagged Peaks]] are dotted with the massive pithead rigs of mines dug deep into the rocky ground. Carts haul ore and salt crystals down the mountain and between refineries and warehouses. Towering furnaces churn out plumes of acrid greenish smoke into the sky, where company banners flap in the breeze.

Most residents are covered in a sheen of sweat and dust at the end of gruelling shifts extracting and refining the precious mineral that fuels the colonial economy. Taverns allow off-shift miners and other workers to blow off steam. Placards stuck to the grimy walls surge increased productivity. A strong [[Steorrian army]] presence fills the role of a security force, ensuring no green salt goes unaccounted for.
### Northern Scattered Isles
Similarly to the [[Southern Scattered Isles]], the Northern Scattered Isles are territories unclaimed by the main powers due to adverse conditions and resource scarcity. They are poorly mapped.

#### Wandering Isle

#### New Destiny
Island in the Northern Scattered Isles, where pirates have established a Republic ([[Republic]]). 
Nestled in the sheltered bay of a small northern island, New Destiny began as little more than a ramshackle outpost where pirates could lie low between raids. As more crews settled there over the decades, it grew into a thriving free port, where all are welcome regardless of background or occupation.

The settlement is a hodgepodge of driftwood structures along muddy lanes, surrounded by ships of all sizes crowded into the busy harbour. Taverns, shops and various services catering to pirates fill the main thoroughfares. Exotic goods and curios from across the Islands and beyond overflow from traders' stalls in the rowdy market square.

While ships load cargo and supplies for their next voyages, crews take advantage of the many taverns and pleasure houses. Laughter, shouts, and occasional brawls spill out into streets from establishments with colourful names like The Salty Wench, The Tipsy Barnacle, and The Mermaid's Embrace.

At the highest point of the island stands the Auction House, where pirates gather to appraise and bid on plundered treasure and magic. The most impressive pieces sell for small fortunes here, further enriching successful crews.

While rough around the edges, New Destiny cherishes freedom, self-determination, and mutual prosperity through trade. Flags from a hundred ships flutter over the town, symbolizing the diverse crews, once rivals, who now call this haven home. The port continues to adapt its haphazard structure to accommodate new vessels - it may look chaotic, but this is one place where everyone belongs.

##### Auction House
The Auction House is a popular establishment on New Destiny where pirates can bid on rare treasures acquired through raids. Its showroom displays exotic curios, art, magic items, and mysterious artefacts from across the Islands up for sale. An eccentric goblin named [[Xander]] officiates the organized chaos of bidding wars between rowdy pirates. Under his watchful eye, they may win valuable additions to their hoard or get swindled by counterfeits if they aren't careful. Those in debt to the Republic may have their possessions sold off here if they can't pay their dues.

##### Priestless Temple
This temple is a simple stone building located on a small, wave-battered islet just off the coast of [[New Destiny]]. It can be accessed via a long suspended bridge.

No specific deity is associated with it. Instead, it contains idols, carvings, and relics representing a diverse array of gods and beliefs from across the Islands and beyond. No religious order or priest manages it and it welcomes visitors regardless of their faith or lack thereof. Pirates often come to pray or make offerings, especially seeking blessings from sea gods before voyages. They leave coins, flowers, incense, art, and other gifts.

The inclusive nature of the temple reflects the diversity of the pirates who come to New Destiny.
##### Shops of the Republic v1
Apart from taverns, here are the main places where individuals spend their hard-earned money on New Destiny. The shopkeepers can give you information on the wares they sell and provide services. Ask them if you are looking for something in particular, as only a sampling of what may be available is presented here.

He is rumoured to also dabble in poison-making.

####### Spellcasting: Sticks and Stones 

Above the door of this quaint little shop hangs a wooden sign depicting a wand and a gem. Inside, the air is heavy with the scent of incense. Shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling, filled with ordinary and exotic spell components. Glass displays contain various stones, more or less precious. The shop is warmly lit by a crystal chandelier, as well as the faint glow emanating from various enchanted wands and staves placed in racks throughout the shop. 
Everything is neatly organised and labelled by the shopkeeper, an older elf named **Valeria**. She has a rivalry with Lungwort of the Dripping Vial, with whom she competes for ingredients that he prefers to use in his potions.

####### Spellcasting: Sticks and Stones 

Above the door of this quaint little shop hangs a wooden sign depicting a wand and a gem. Inside, the air is heavy with the scent of incense. Shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling, filled with ordinary and exotic spell components. Glass displays contain various stones, more or less precious. The shop is warmly lit by a crystal chandelier, as well as the faint glow emanating from various enchanted wands and staves placed in racks throughout the shop. 
Everything is neatly organised and labelled by the shopkeeper, an older elf named **Valeria**. She has a rivalry with Lungwort of the Dripping Vial, with whom she competes for ingredients that he prefers to use in his potions.

#### Otarky
Otarky is an island in the [[Northern Scattered Isles]]. The peculiar climate of the region leads to a frequent heavy fog, as well as unique flora comprising rare species of giant mushrooms that grow in the swampy forests in the middle of the island.

When harvested young and small, these mushrooms are edible and serve as the primary food source for the island. As they mature, their texture becomes too fibrous for consumption, yet they prove valuable as a light yet solid substitute for wood known as [[Shroomwood]]. The fibrous mushrooms can also be torn into strands and woven into ropes or cloth.

The town of [[Otarkys]] in the South extracts and processes fibres from the mushrooms while [[Otarkyn]] in the North specialises in shroomwood.

#### Áine
Named after the eldest of [[The Three Siblings]], Áine is the jewel of the [[Siblín Guilds]]. It is a city of craft, commerce, and culture that shines through the archipelago from the largest island in the Siblín triplet. It is one of the most densely populated places in the Islands. Facing an ever-growing number of inhabitants, and with no space to extend out, the city had to grow inwards. The buildings, mostly made of brightly painted stone and plaster, seem stacked on top of each other, covering the hills. Between them, Áine's labyrinthine streets weave their way to every corner of the island. Three main canals also flow through the city, dividing it into different quarters and connecting it to the sea at three busy harbours. The Trade Harbour is the largest in the Siblíns and the main port of entry for foreign ships. It is divided into different areas, with some reserved for ships belonging to members of the Siblín Guilds, and others for ships belonging to visitors from abroad. Each area is further divided into zones where different checks are carried out. Therefore, arriving ships may have to wait for a long time before being allowed to disembark and enter the city proper. 

The city is always bustling with activity, crowded with people and carts. The air is filled with the smells and sounds emanating from workshops and market stalls. Members of different guilds meet and debate in a multitude of guild houses. Locations are often named after the trades that dominate them, such as Potter's Corner, Lacy Lane, and Baker Street. 

The craftsmanship and prosperity of the Siblíns are visible in every detail of the architecture and environment. Besides the statues and fountains dotted around the city, several notable landmarks make Áine unique: the [[Túram]], the  [[Eólas Library]], the [[Great Guildhall]].

Áine is a city of contrasts and surprises, where every corner reveals something new and different. It is a city that guards its secrets and traditions, but also welcomes traders from all over and embraces innovation. It is a city of many layers, both literally and figuratively. One of these layers is the Overcity, a large collection of bridges and walkways that connect balconies and terraces among the tiled roofs. Over the most affluent area of Áine, the Overcity is mostly made of elegantly crafted glass platforms, home to hanging gardens and a [[Menagerie]] where rare and exotic plants and animals can be admired. More hidden, the Sidecity is a series of covered passages that connect different parts of the city. These alternative routes are often located above street-level, concealed by buildings or courtyards. Away from the elements and the crowds, the Sidecity forms an oasis of quiet unknown by most visitors. More secretive still, the Undercity encompasses the dark underground network of sewers and other water systems, as well as the catacombs located beneath Áine. Nowadays, it is largely flooded and only specialised workers and scoundrels know how to access and navigate it.

####### History

######## The Old Áine Tower 
The site of the Túram was originally home to the Áine tower, erected during the early days of settlement on the island. This tower was a simple stone structure, built as a watchtower and a beacon for incoming ships. As the settlement around the tower grew into a bustling port, the tower became a symbol of unity and guidance, representing safety and welcome to travellers and traders. Over the years, the old Áine tower was expanded and adorned, reflecting the growing prosperity of the city. It housed a beacon fire, visible for miles, and served as a meeting point. 
######## The Transformation into the Túram
A great fire eventually led to the destruction of the old Áine tower. New lighthouses had taken away some of its relevance, so the idea for the Túram was born – a structure that would  serve as a symbolic beacon and a marvel of engineering. 
Led by Ronan Chlog, the construction of the Túram was one of the first Board Grand Projects. It was a monumental effort, combining the skills of the finest members of multiple guilds. The new tower was designed to incorporate elements of the old tower's architecture as an homage to its legacy. The Túram was built with advanced mechanics and magical elements, far surpassing the old tower's capabilities. It was designed to serve as a timekeeper, weather predictor, and navigational aid, symbolizing the advancement and innovation of Áine.
######## The Túram in Modern Times 
Today, the Túram stands not only as a functional edifice but also as a historical monument, embodying the spirit of the old Áine tower. Watching over the market square, it serves as a reminder of the city's journey from a humble settlement to a thriving center of commerce and culture.
