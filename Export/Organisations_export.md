## Circos
Circos is an island city-state that is a protectorate of Selvea ([[Organisations/Selvea/Selvea]]) 

Among the coral-hued archways of Circos, one finds the heart of sea elven culture beating strongly within the Selvean Empire. These seafaring folks have made the crescent-shaped island their principal home for generations, carrying on the ancient oceanic traditions of their nomadic ancestors.

the isle of Circos stands as the luminous heart of sea elven culture within the Selvean Empire's maritime realms. Here, sweeping archways of pale luminescent stone and winding waterways reflect the celestial cycles that have guided these seafarers through ages of exploration across the Emerald Seas.

**Children of Savisi'lo's Tides**  
Central to sea elven society is the reverence for Savisi'lo, the great whale deity portrayed as the benevolent warden of the ocean's depths. It is by Savisi'lo's grace that the tides ebb and flow, guiding the souls of the dead to their final repose at the sacred coral reef of Pupaia. The arrival of each new moon ushers in the Moontide Rituals, where sea elves make offerings to appease the whale god and ensure bountiful waters.

Whales themselves are regarded as living embodiments of Savisi'lo and treated with utmost reverence. Grave misfortune is said to befall any who dare mistreat these gentle leviathans - their souls cursed to endlessly roam the black depths.

**Masters of the Emerald Tides**  
Beyond their spiritual beliefs, the sea elves of Circos are unmatched masters of all matters relating to the sea. Their maritime prowess and accumulated knowledge of currents, winds, and celestial navigation form the backbone of the Selvean Empire's dominance over the Emerald Seas.

The Moonsinger order of scholars and astrologers use their command over lunar cycles and tidal patterns to ensure safe maritime routes. In the Moonpearl Gardens, exotic aquatic flora is carefully cultivated by the light of the moon's rays.

And within artisan quarters, gifted Tideweavers endlessly spin tapestries depicting the epic voyages and oceanic legends passed down over generations of oral tradition under the moon's watchful gaze.

As eternal as the lunar tides shaping their lives, the sea elves remain steadfast keepers of the emerald waters. Their bond with the cycles of moon and sea has allowed them to thrive as guides, guardians, and heralds of an aquatic realm few surface-dwellers can comprehend.

## Hakari Sea Elves
The Hakari sea elves were Tanawhu cultists, expelled from their lands by the powerful sea elven tribes and cursed to live out their days on the surface of the Hakari crags, treacherous rocks that found no visitors. They are rocky crags rising out of the ocean made liveable by the stilts, huts, and colourful decoration. From here they would hunt whales to appease Tanawhu and try to eke out an existence.

The Hakari sea elves maintain a strong abhorrence of the magics practised by newcomers to the Islands. They believe these magics will bring about the doom of The Islands. The Hakari do however practice a form of sorcery through a mythical substance they called mana, found in the bellies of whales. They sacrifice the whale mana in rituals to their god Tanawhu, tentacled god of the sunken forests in exchange for its boons and powers. Tanawhu is depicted sometimes as a giant octopus and sometimes as a half octopus half man figure. 

#### GPT suggestions
If the Hakari sea elves despise the magic practiced by the Steorrians settlers and the Siblín Guilds, but practice their own form of sorcery through the mythical substance called mana, found in the bellies of whales, this could be a source of tension and conflict between the different factions in a D&D campaign. Some possible ways in which this tension and conflict could manifest include:

The Hakari sea elves may view the magic practiced by the Steorrians and the Siblín Guilds as inferior or corrupt, and may be hostile or dismissive towards those who use it. They may see their own sorcery, which is tied to their god Tanawhu and the whales, as superior and more natural.
  
The Steorrians and the Siblín Guilds may view the Hakari sea elves' sorcery as barbaric or primitive, and may be hostile or dismissive towards those who use it. They may see their own magic, which is learned and practiced through academies and guilds, as superior and more advanced.

## Clawed Clans
The Clawed Clans form a loose union of various beast folk clans without a central power, based on the series of volcanic islands known as the [[Dragon's Spine]], which they have occupied for untold generations. Oral histories describe their creation by the cosmic [[Big Beasts]] who emerged from the original chaos.

Early on, the Clans often warred against one another. But faced with encroaching threats from outsiders, they forged a loose confederation for defence. With Steorrian ([[Steorr]]) and Selvean ([[Organisations/Selvea/Selvea]]) increased interest in conquest, ties strengthened . Despite persisting conflicts, the Clans remain bound by similar language, cosmologies, and traditions. Inter-marriage helps maintain their alliance over generations.

#### Culture and religion
Beast folks of the Clawed Clans believe that Big Beasts, powerful animal-like spirits, have created the natural world and all its inhabitants. Each clan traces its ancestry to a different animal, serving as both their patron deity and cultural identity. For example, Bearfolk revere the Slumbering Bear and value patience, while Wolffolk revere Sharptooth ans paint tribal markings in blood. Though identities centre on clans, they see each other as kin united by faith in the Big Beasts. 

Although methods of selecting chiefs vary, they are considered the leaders of their family and clan. Clans most often dwell in communal longhouses decorated with carved totems, wall paintings, and pelts. There are designated spaces for dining, sleeping, crafting, and rituals with intermingled generations. As part of coming-of age-rituals, youths are sent to live in other clans. This often lead to inter-clan marriages, blending families across clan lines and strengthening bonds.

The shamans of each tribe are keepers of lore, medicine, and magic tied to their ancestral beasts. Vision quests in which they channel their patron's spirit are crucial for guidance. Shamans oversee rites of passage, omens, and festivals. Ceremonies involve wearing capes or headdresses adorned with feathers, teeth, fur and other trophies to invoke the Big Beasts' favour and protection. Music and massive bonfires are part of every major ritual.

**Dreadful Dragon**
Dragonborn living on the active volcanoes south of [[Dragon's Spine]] believe that the chain of islands is the body of a gargantuan ancient dragon deity that will one day rise up again, causing fiery destruction and renewal.
When the volcanoes erupt, Dragonborn clans perform ceremonies to celebrate the dragon god becoming active once more. Sacrifices are thrown into the mouths of volcanos and effigies are built from lava rock. Believers hope this will hasten the prophesied return of the Dreadful Dragon.
#### Economy
Local fishing, farming and hunting make up the majority of resources for the clans. While raiding passing ships for riches remains a rite of valour for young warriors of some clans, peaceful trade has grown. Some clans maintain trade relationship with other countries.
#### The Conclave
Twice a year, on solstices, the chieftains of every clan meet during the Clawed Clan Conclave, hosted by each of the Clans on a rotating basis. They decide on matters that affect all of the Clans, especially on issues of defence against outsiders. While the meeting itself is private, it is accompanied by several days of feasting, during which delegations mingle. Disputes may be settled through contests.

Here are some additional details and expanded elements to further flesh out the Clawed Clans' religion, politics, culture and make them feel like a vibrant, living society:

Religion/Cosmology
- The primordial Big Beasts are vast, near-elemental embodiments of the fundamental forces of nature (earth, sky, sun, moon, storms, etc.)
- They exist in the Incarnadine, a metaphysical realm that intersects with the Prime Material Plane in locations like volcanoes, deep forests, etc.
- Different clans revere different Big Beast Incarnations as their patrons based on geography and natural features of their home islands
- Shamans undergo visionary quests to attain spiritual Ram-Masks that allow them to channel the Incarnations and tap into primordial powers
- Key religious festivals, like the Night of Howling Fire, are timed around astrological and volcanic events of significance
- The Dragonborn volcanic cult actually venerates the Dreadful Dragon as one of the oldest, most powerful Big Beast Incarnations

Politics/Governance  
- While united as the Clawed Clans, each individual clan is sovereign and self-governing under their respective chieftains
- Clan lineages and kinship ties are crucial - newborn children are symbolically offered clan status based on their blood relations
- A council of clan elders advises each chieftain, with specific roles like loremaster, warchief, ceremoniarch, etc.
- Induction trials like dream-quests, trials of endurance, or ritual scarification are required before joining a clan council
- At the Conclave, established customs like the Smokefire Debates allow clans to ceremonially air grievances before arbitration
- Intermarriage is encouraged to maintain stability - children of mixed clans can choose their clan identity during Rites of Distinction  

Culture/Society
- Most clans are semi-nomadic, following set migration paths based on seasons and availability of resources
- Temporary clan campsites like the mammoth-bone Kalnakai are dismantled and reassembled each migration cycle  
- Vibrant traditions of body art (species-specific), maskmaking, woodcarving, and tapestry weaving exist
- Totemic dances, spirit-haunted music from bone flutes/drums, and mythic storytelling are key art forms
- Clan warriors focus on specific tactical spheres - Wolfclan are stealthy huntsmen, Bearclan are furious berserkers, etc.
- Ritual shamanic duels, sacred games of strategy, and celestial games are deeply embedded in their culture
- A complex code of ecological ethics and respect for nature's order governs the clans' philosophy

By delving into these types of granular details, you can really bring the vibrancy and depth of the Clawed Clans' society to life. It makes them a fully realized culture existing in the larger world, rather than just a background element.

### The Bards
The Bards are a pirate crew that is part of [[Republic]]. Their ship The Banshee is equipped with large pipe through which water and air can move and create sound, making it a sort of giant musical instrument. Their flag depicts a white harp on a black background, looking like a distorted smile. They are known for singing loud and catchy songs during their raids, both to intimidate their opponents and to celebrate their victories. The main song they sing before an assault is [[The Song of the Banshee]].

The Song of the Banshee is an eerie pirate ballad sung by Captain Wayne MacGoshan and his crew The Bards before attacking a target. The lyrics tell of a vengeful banshee that comes for those who hear her mournful singing. When Wayne's magical voice echoes across the water, a ghostly banshee illusion appears, sending chills down enemies' spines. The song weakens their resolve while empowering the pirates for battle.

## Selvea
Selvea is a elven empire that originated in the Islands. Its cities were built on tall mesas on an island in the south of the archipelago. Its capital is Selvea (city) ([[Selvea (city)]]) and other cities include Torroccia, Fiumille, and Meridion. Selvea has extended its sphere of influence, often clashing with [[Steorr]]. An uneasy peace was reached after Steorr failed to take back the province of Harbourjaw Selvea had annexed.

Selvea has a ruling family, among which the Speaker and the Keeper are chosen and form a duumvirate. The Speaker is mostly in charge of foreign policy, while the Keeper takes care of domestic policy. They both hold religious power. Only members of the ruling family and the people they chose practise magic, it is seen as a boon from the gods.
 
Selvea view the Islands as their ancestral right, they have a deep connection to the land and sea surrounding it. They are syncretic and pluralist, integrating other beliefs into their own.

Their capital is made of pyramids built in the jungle, carved from the stone of the mesas. A network of rivers is used for transportation across the island of Selvea, with nimble long boats similar to canoes. Larger versions, fast and manoeuvrable, go out at sea. 

Selvea resents the Kingdom of Steorr for their attempts to colonize the archipelago and impose their culture and beliefs on the native inhabitants, seeing the kingdom as a threat to their way of life.

Selvea should have a more nuanced, less Western imperialistic approach compared to Steorr. 

**Selvea** refers to both the elven capital and empire situated within the southern jungles of Domiselvea.

#### History

Selvea traces its lineage back thousands of years, when its inhabitants used magic to transform the wild jungles into a thriving civilization. Rather than conquest, they expanded their influence through trade and 
Many islands became protectorates, retaining local governance while adopting Selvean language, arts, architecture, and magic traditions. Intermarriage incorporated noble families into the elven bloodlines. Puppet rulers allowed indirect rule.

Wars flared when islands resisted absorption into the Selvean sphere. But the empire prefers subtly exerting economic and cultural dominance over naked military force.

#### Culture
Selvean culture values refinement, scholarly knowledge, and mastery over both nature and arcane secrets. Practitioners devote decades to perfecting spellwork and art forms. Cuisine utilizes exotic jungle fare and botanical alchemy.

Sit on the ground to remain connected to the world 
Blood mix with rivers and earth to symbolise union with nature 
Ritualistic suicide and sacrifice 
#### Government

The imperial family rules from a lavish tiered palace complex situated atop monumental stepped pyramids within the capital. Members of client noble families fill advisory and administrative roles.

Policies promote the spread language, customs, architecture, and beliefs 
Loyalty is maintained through a mix of sanctions, patronage, and soft power rather than brute force.

Among the elven architects and artists who designed Selvea's iconic grand pyramids, there is a persistent myth that the structures were not merely built - but grown. It claims that through still-secret techniques merging magic, music and agricultural art, the pyramids sprouted from germinated monolithic seeds over generations.
This process allowed the pyramids' growth to be carefully cultivated and controlled to achieve their incredibly precise dimensions and alignment to celestial forces. As they grew, the living pyramids were suffused with metaphysical energy and subtle enchantments through measured applications of spellsong and powerful artifacts.
Once reaching their maturity, the pyramids' growth was arrested to fix their forms, now only requiring maintenance. Some believe the pyramids still hold a dormant sentience or cosmic connection, awaiting the right sublime catalyst to rouse their

#### ai suggestions 
Absolutely, let's further explore how Selvea's social structure and culture could be developed by drawing more inspiration from Mesoamerican civilizations:

Caste System
Like the rigid class hierarchies in Aztec and Maya societies, Selvea could have a very defined caste system. At the top would be the ruling nobility class from which the imperial family descends. They would be considered directly tied to the gods and hold total political/military power.

Beneath them would be the priestly caste - those allowed to study astronomy, mathematics, calendrics and religion. Only they could interpret writings and codices.

The next tier could be the class of artisan nobles who oversee the construction of grand pyramids, plazas and engineering works through specialized guilds of stonemasons, sculptors and architects. 

The merchant caste facilitates trade and transportation of goods between Selvea's core territories and vassal/client states throughout the island empire.

Finally, there would be the stable commoner class of farmers providing labor and sustainance for the civilization. Slaves captured in conflict with rival kingdoms would exist outside the caste hierarchy.

Religion and Human Sacrifice
Drawing from Maya, Aztec and other Mesoamerican beliefs, Selvea's state religion could revolve around a complex pantheon of nature deities represented through elaborate rituals, ceremonies and even human sacrifice to ensure agricultural fertility, avert disasters and uphold the cosmic order. 

Conquering enemies and ceremonially offering high-status captives to the gods could be a major driver of Selvea's imperialistic ambitions and a core part of its warrior culture.

Calendar Systems  
Like their real-world counterparts, Selvea's priestly caste could utilize advanced astronomical observations and intricate calendar systems. Perhaps they experience apocalyptic events when cosmic cycles realign on dates calculated with great precision.


Social Structure Divergences
- Rather than a strict hereditary nobility, Selvea's upper castes could be more merit-based, with admittance regulated through ritualistic tests of skill, intelligence and fortitude overseen by priestly orders.
- Instead of typical Euro feudal landed lords, have a more centralized system where high-ranking castes are essentially drawn from monastic/scholar-warrior orders dedicated to upholding Selvean philosophy and values.
- De-emphasize the feudal aspect by making Selvea's territories more akin to a decentralized, ritualized tributary system between semi-autonomous city-states.

Religious Distinctions
- Polytheistic nature worship over typical Western monotheistic analogues. The gods are elemental forces to be kept in balance, not moral arbiters.
- Reframe human sacrifice as a consensual, honored obligation rather than an enforced subjugation. Voluntary "star-cults" who ritualistically offer themselves.
- Seamless integration of religion into every aspect of life, knowledge, and civic ceremony rather than an established dogmatic church structure.

Architectural Divergences  
- Rather than traditional medieval castle/keep design, double down on Mesoamerican-inspired towering pyramids and carved stone cities integrated with the environment.
- Incorporate cosmic alignments and advanced astronomy into the orientation and layout of major ceremonial structures and observatories.
- Use of living building materials like sculpted trees/vines and waterworks alongside stonework in creative ways.

By leaning further into cultural distinctions inspired by Mesoamerican sources that diverge from typical Western fantasy norms, Selvea's society can feel truly unique while still resonating with an authentically developed alternate history. Let me know if you would like me to expand on any of these concepts further!

Cities constructed in line with Mesoamerican urban planning -
buildings centered on plazas for rituals, surrounded by pyramids and temples, with residential clusters nearby
•Pyramids have intricate carved relief Sculptures depicting apocalyptic events, deities, cosmological symbols
Calendars use a 52-year cycle "bundle" akin to the Mesoamerican ritual calendar round, with years represented as Glyphs
Priests perform astronomical observations and numerological divinations to reaffirm cosmic order is maintained
Blood rituals sacrifice humans (prisoners, slaves, debtors) by removing still-beating hearts with obsidian blades
Art/iconography rich with depictions of serpents, jaguars, eagles devouring human hearts Some commoners file their teeth into jagged shards as a mark of piety

and monumental architecture to their religious practices of human sacrifice and following convoluted calendars/celestial prophecies. •Have a strict, multi-tiered caste/ class system that governs all aspects of Selvean society, potentialy with lineage and bloodlines being extremely important. Blend this with an imperialistic drive to continually expand their cultural influence through subjugation of outside peoples.
Develop unique Selvean artistic and scientific endeavors like hieroglyphic writing systems, sophisticated metallurgy, advanced mathematics/ astronomy, and masterful masonry that flaunts their sophistication compared to lesser "barbarian" cultures.
Give Selvean magic/religion an obsession with concepts of duality, balance, cyclical rebirth and death they could worship co-existing but opposing deities or be trying to uphold cosmic order.

The elven city of Selvea could be built around the concept of cosmic alignments, with pyramids and temples oriented to specific stars or constellations believed to be the manifestations of their deities.
Introduce a ritualistic "bloodletting" practice among Selvea's elite, where they sacrifice a small amount of their own blood to appease the gods and ensure cosmic balance. This could be a highly revered and sacred tradition.
Develop a complex system of numerology and calendars based on the cycles of nature, which the elves use to predict astrological events, plan religious festivals, and determine auspicious dates for important events.

## Siblín Guilds
#### Description
The Siblín Guilds are a diverse conglomerate of skilled craftspeople and merchants who formed a major commerce centre in the Islands, from their three city-islands of [[Áine]], [[Ben]], and [[Cad]]. They maintain trade relationships with most of the major powers of the archipelago, including Selvea and the Kingdom of Steorr. 

#### Culture
According to legend, a few hundred years ago, Áine and her younger brothers Ben and Cad discovered a triplet of islands and formed a country there with a few followers. Cad harvested materials, Ben crafted items, and Áine sold finished products.
The historicity of this story is debated as there are no records of these three people before the Steorrian conquest in the archipelago. Their race and the fact that they were siblings are also disputed information. Regardless, they are important figures in the society of the Guilds. Some people venerate them as gods, while others see them as symbols to emulate. 
People from all over the region have emigrated to the Siblíns and brought their crafts and religions with them. However, a large portion of the population has adopted the local customs. They honour the siblings and the skills and resourcefulness they represent. Siblín culture values hard work, fair commerce, and advancement through merit.

The Siblíns see unrestricted magic as dangerous and requiring oversight.

#### Government
The Siblín Guilds are a corporatist society that is very organised and divided between numerous guilds. A guild is an association that regulates a specific trade in terms of production, quality, training It protects the interests of its members but also enforces rules on them. Every working person or employer must be part of a guild.
The supreme ruling body of the Siblíns is the Board of the Guilds. It consists of 99 seats, which are allocated to the guilds based on the amount of taxes they pay. The seats are reassigned every year, based on the latest tax records. Each seat has one vote, and the majority rules. In case of a tie, the Chair, a special seat elected by all board members, breaks the tie. The Board decides on matters of national and international scope, such as trade agreements, security, diplomacy, law It also appoints or dismisses various officials, such as port authorities, inspectors, judges The Board of the Guilds can also resolve any disputes or conflicts that arise between the guilds.

Collectively, employees and appointees of the Board such as judges, guards, and officials are known informally as the Guild of the Board. People with suitable skills and loyalty to the Guilds are often identified through the military or civil service every citizen has to go through. There are no guard guild or such, as these are the responsibility of the Board. 

This system could ensure that the most powerful and influential merchants and artisans have a greater say in the decision-making process of the Siblíns, and it could also provide an incentive for these merchants and artisans to pay their taxes in order to gain more influence and power. However, this system could also lead to corruption and inequality, as the wealthiest and most powerful merchants could use their money and influence to gain even more power and control over the Siblíns.

#### Tax system

##### Guild Fees
Every Siblín citizen must join and maintain membership in one of the trade guilds. Fees collected include:
- Entry Fee: upfront payment when initially joining a guild, varying based on the guild's prestige.
- Annual Dues: yearly flat rate paid to the guild, reevaluated annually based on operating costs.
- Percentage Fees: Many guilds take a set percentage of members' business earnings/income.
##### Head Tax
In addition to guild dues, the guilds are tasked with collecting an annual Head Tax from each of their members on behalf of the Board of Guilds. This per capita tax is paid directly to the Board.
##### Tariffs and Import Fees
For goods imported through Siblín ports, the Board directly assesses tariffs and customs duties based on the type of resource and country of origin. These fees are paid by merchants before shipments enter the country.

##### Guild Contributions to the Board 
The primary revenue source for funding the Board's bureaucracy comes from contributions paid by each guild, as a proportion of their revenue. The amount a guild pays to the Board annually determines how many representative seats that guild receives on the ruling Board of Guilds.

Wealthier, more profitable guilds can choose to pay higher contributions to secure greater representation and legislative power within the Board's governance. Poorer guilds pay less but have less influence over policies.

Overall, the tax system architecture encourages the most successful guilds to buy into greater control, while the Board benefits from taxing imports, collecting head taxes channelled through guilds, and receiving scaled contributions for representation. It maintains multiple reinforcing revenue streams while putting the onus of taxation primarily on guilds rather than directly on businesses or citizens.
#### Entry into Siblín territory
Although the Siblíns are diverse, they have grown more protective over the years. No one is allowed to enter the Siblíns without a member of the Guilds who vouches for them. This could be a business partner, an employer, or a service provider for example. Harbours are patrolled by guards and other officials, who enforce the strict rules and regulations governing who can enter and what can be brought in, checking paperwork and credentials.

### Eason Press
Eason Press is one of the most influential businesses operating within the Siblín Guilds. As the preeminent publishing house, they hold a virtual monopoly on the printing and distribution of materials throughout the island nation.

**History**  
The company traces its origins to a print shop opened in Áine by siblings Norimor and Neverins Eason. Their meticulous craftsmanship and innovation in typography quickly drew attention from the Board guilds. The Eason Press was granted exclusive contracts to handle official documentation and publications.

Eason Press has vast facilities with rows of clattering printing presses operating around the clock. They employ hundreds of binders, typesetters, engravers and other artisans sworn to exacting standards.

Most materials circulated in the Siblín Guild, from guild ledgers and merchant contracts to books and broadsheets, emanate from Eason Press.

Beyond its printing monopoly, Eason Press serves as the de facto regulator and gatekeeper for published content across the islands. The company censors and redacts works before permitting reproduction, giving the family patriarchs immense influence over what knowledge reaches the public's hands. Norimor Eason and his staff of loremaster editors scrutinize manuscripts and submissions. This vetting process is shrouded in secrecy and fraught with allegations of selective censorship.
### Guildless
The Guildless in the Undercity are a diverse and resilient community comprised of individuals who, for various reasons, are not part of any official guilds in the Siblíns society. This includes people marginalized due to disabilities, criminal records, or societal rejection, as well as those who have fallen from grace or chosen to leave the guild system.

They have a loose organizational structure, not led by a single individual. The Guildless rely on mutual support, sharing resources and skills. Operating outside the guild-regulated economy, they rely on a barter system and an informal economy, providing services and goods unavailable through official channels. The Guildless maintain several safe houses and secret meeting spots in the Undercity, serving as refuges and communal areas for their members. The group represents a wide array of cultural backgrounds, creating a melting pot of traditions and practices within their community. Members of the Guildless face constant struggles, including poverty, danger, and discrimination from the broader society and the guilds. They form an essential part of the Undercity's social fabric, often holding valuable information and serving as a crucial link in the city's informal networks. Without formal representation in government, the Guildless represent the struggles and resilience of those living on the margins of society, highlighting themes of community, survival, and the quest for recognition and rights within a rigidly structured societal system.

Another captivating topic that can be expanded in your D&D campaign is the **Guildless community in the Undercity of Áine**. This topic offers a rich narrative vein for exploring themes of societal fringe groups, their struggles, dynamics, and the potential for intrigue and adventure that lies beneath the surface of the city. Here’s how you could flesh out this aspect:

###### Expanded Description of the Guildless Community

####### Community Structure and Culture
- **Diverse Composition:** The Guildless are a melting pot of various races and backgrounds, including outcasts, exiles, and those rejected by the guilds above. This diversity creates a unique subculture that blends elements from across the archipelago and beyond.
- **Adaptation and Innovation:** Living in the margins, the Guildless have adapted by creating their own makeshift society. They repurpose discarded materials from above to build their homes and tools, leading to a visually distinct and resourceful community.

####### Leadership and Organization
- **Loose Confederation:** The Guildless are not organized under a single leader but operate through a network of loosely affiliated groups, each with its own leader or council. These groups often specialize in different trades or services that cater to the needs of the Undercity.
- **Barter Economy:** Without access to official currency or markets, the Guildless rely on a barter system. Reputation and trust are vital, as the community's economy hinges on mutual aid and exchange.

####### Challenges and Conflicts
- **Persecution from Above:** The Guildless often face oppression from the city authorities and guilds who view them as a nuisance or a threat to the orderly society of Áine.
- **Internal Strife:** While the Guildless are united by their exclusion from the surface, conflicts can arise from competition for resources, ideological differences, or clashes between different racial or cultural groups within the community.

###### Implementations of the Guildless Community

1. **Campaign Quests and Adventures:**
   - **Undercity Rescue Mission:** The players must venture into the Undercity to rescue a kidnapped surface dweller, navigating the complex politics and dangers of the Guildless community.

### Wesson family
The Wessons are an influential family in the Siblíns, with memberships in the Transporters Guild, the Hostelry Guild, and the Winemakers Guild. They wield large amount of power on the Board, with 14 seats currently held by family members and associates. They are also rumoured to be involved in various schemes. Pierce and Erin Wesson are the power couple who heads the family.

#### Fishers Guild
The Fishers Guild is a guild in the Siblín Islands. Members fish the seas surrounding the islands, providing a vital food source to the nation. Ships and small boats sail daily from the major ports like Áine, returning heavy with catch. The guild maintains strict quotas and regulations on fishing areas, seasons, and allowable methods. They also run processing plants, distribution centres, and fish markets. Recently, whaling has become an very profitable activity for the guild.

#### Merchants Guild
Among the elite trade guilds comprising the governance of the Siblín Islands, the Merchants Guild wields immense economic influence as the preeminent authority over import/export commerce and large-scale goods trading. 

###### History and Purpose

Originating from collectives of traders and ship merchants in the earliest colonial days, the Merchants Guild consolidated into a chartered fraternity by the 800s S.E. Their mandate was facilitating regulated import/export operations, negotiating trade agreements, and maintaining controlled flows of goods to drive the islands' prosperity.

###### Organisation 

The modern guild is headquartered in Áine, with the Primacy of Trade leadership council governing affairs. All trading companies, importers, exporters and large-scale merchants must hold exclusive guild licenses to operate within Siblín territories.

The guild oversees:

**Import/Export**
- Negotiating contracts and trade agreements with other nations
- Inspecting and certifying all incoming/outgoing cargo inventories
- Assessing tariffs and duties on imported/exported goods  

**Mercantile Licensing**
- Issuing rights for companies to import/export specific goods
- Regulating markets, merchant stalls, trade corridors in cities
- Maintaining quality standards for traded products

###### Taxation and Fees

The Merchants Guild leverages its control over trade to generate immense revenue streams that help fund the Board of Guilds:

- Exorbitant upfront entry fees for exclusive membership 
- Import/export tariffs and duties on all goods
- Mandatory annual contributions to the Board (higher fees = more council seats)
- Taxes on business transactions and merchant revenues

###### Assets and Power

Representing the wealthiest magnates, the guild owns immense vaults of stockpiled goods, commodities and treasures in Áine. This liquid fortune fuels its prosperity and reputation as monopolistic "Lords of Trade."

Critics accuse the increasingly insular guild of being a self-serving oligarchy. However, its lavish profits also fund public works and secure preferential trade policies benefitting all Siblíns.

The Merchants Guild continuously vies to expand its influence within the islands' governance - its economic control translating into political leverage over the Board of Guilds itself.

#### Paper and Ink Guild
The Paper and Ink Guild is one of the most powerful and influential guilds at the centre of the Siblín Islands' intricate system of governance. By controlling publishing, printing, and documentation production, they play an absolutely vital role in facilitating the nation's complex bureaucracy and trade policies.

**History and Purpose**  
As the earliest settlers established the island territories, the need for preserving records on paper quickly emerged. Informal printers' and papermakers' cooperatives evolved into an official chartered guild by the 950s S.E. Their mandate was standardizing and regulating materials like ink, paper, and printed works across the islands.

**Indispensable Role in Governance**
The Siblín Islands' governing model relies on an extensive bureaucracy of tariffs, contracts, dues, laws, and regulations. This intricate system is effectively held together by the mountains of paperwork, documentation, and verified records generated by the Paper and Ink Guild's printing presses. 

No merchant ship can be unloaded without stamped cargo manifests produced by guild printers. Legal certifications, immigration documents, tax ledgers - all originate from authenticated sources within the guild's domain. Even the countless official decrees and writs from the Board of Guilds flow from their scriptoriums.

This indispensable role makes the Paper and Ink Guild's services critical to every other trade guild's operations. A hypothetical labor strike would grind the entire governing apparatus to a halt within days. The implied threat of such systemic disruption is a powerful check on the guild's influence being curtailed.

**Activities and Operations**
To meet ceaseless bureaucratic demands, the guild's activities are divided into three branches:

Printing - Overseeing papermaking mills, print shops, binderies and all physical manufacturing aspects of printed materials.

Publishing - Handling editorial, marketing and distribution of finished books, pamphlets, broadsides, and other published works. 

Reportage - The newest arm focused on newspapers, bulletins, news-writing and periodical literature. Censors also review works here.

The opulent Paper and Ink Guildhall in Áine serves as headquarters, with branches across the islands. The facility's Presses Vault runs day and night, housing huge industrial cylinder presses fed by underground paper mills to meet insatiable demand.

**Power and Controversies**
Critics frequently accuse the guild of censorship, bias toward establishment interests, and suppressing unflattering news reports that could destabilize power structures. Their cozy ties to the ruling Board raise concerns over lack of a free press.

However, most  Siblíns acknowledge the guild's indispensable role in facilitating bureaucracy and commerce through authenticated documentation. This institutional centrality is their greatest strength - any serious disruption would throw the entire governing system into chaos.

Whether printing trade contracts or official Board decrees, the Paper and Ink Guild's presses are the core engine printing the reams of red tape holding Siblín society together. This enshrined indispensability grants them immense leverage to shape policies and preserve their elite status.



Organization:
- Headed by a Council of Masters, composed of the most accomplished and influential members from various branches (printing, publishing, papermaking, etc.)
- Day-to-day operations overseen by Guildmasters for each branch (e.g. Guildmaster of Printing, Guildmaster of Publishing)
- Hierarchical structure with ranks like Master, Journeyman, Apprentice, etc. based on skills and experience
- Dedicated facilities like printing houses, papermaking mills, binderies, etc. owned and operated by the guild

Internal Processes:
- Strict quality control measures for all paper, ink, and printed materials produced by members
- Rigorous training programs for new apprentices, covering various specializations
- Peer review system for vetting new publications or important works before printing
- Research and development efforts to improve techniques, discover new materials, etc.
- Enforcement of guild regulations, trade secrets, and intellectual property rights

Advancement and Privileges: 
- Promotions based on proven skills, experience, and contributions to the guild
- Higher ranks granted more prestigious assignments, access to rare materials/techniques
- Ability to take on apprentices and pass down knowledge/techniques
- Revenue sharing model where a portion of profits goes to the guild and higher ranks
- Exclusive access to the guild's libraries, archives, and scholarly resources

## Steorr
The Kingdom of Steorr is a one of the most powerful countries in the world, located on the continent now known as [[Old Lands]]. In the Islands, the name Steorr is often used to refer to its Colony, that it established thanks to its technological prowess. The citizens of Steorr are of various races that include Humans, Halflings, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs.

#### History
The history of Steorr is deeply linked with the [[Unwavering Star]]. It is said that Astron, the son of one of the ancient warring clans of the [[Old Lands]], was born on the same day as the Star appeared in the sky. Thanks to his family's belief in his prophetic nature, military might, and diplomatic acumen, he united a multitude of clans under his rule and became known as King Astron the Unifier, the first king of Steorr and the first saint of the [[Church of the Unwavering Star]]. The year 35 SL, when the last human kingdom bent the knee, is considered the establishment of the Kingdom of Steorr. Territorial expansion continued over the next centuries, bringing much of the eastern seaboard under Steorrian control and solidifying the Kingdom as the dominant force on the continent.

In 1028 SL, an expedition was launched across the ocean in pursuit of the Unwavering Star. This voyage led to the discovery of the archipelago that became known as the Islands the following year. Drawn by warm climates, turquoise waters, and plentiful natural resources, more daring Steorrians flocked to the Islands. Thanks to a powerful navy and advanced technology, settlers from the Kingdom easily established themselves on the Grand Isle, Crater Isle, and Jagged Isle, forming the Colony of Steorr. Native inhabitants were either assimilated or displaced under Steorrian authority.

Today, the Kingdom continues to spread its influence from the mainland to holdings across the Islands. However, tensions simmer with rival powers and within the Colony itself. 

#### Government
Steorr is a monarchy ruled by King Ferrin III from the royal palace in the capital city of Hafensted. The monarch holds absolute power and claims to rule by divine right of the Unwavering Star.

Steorrian society is organised into a class hierarchy. Noble houses rule over provinces in the king's name and must furnish soldiers and taxes to support the crown. The [[Church of the Unwavering Star]] and its clergy wield considerable influence over policies. Merchants and professionals form a growing middle class, while peasants and laborers have the lowest status.

The monarch appoints a royal governor who administers the colony on the Crown's behalf. This governor has broad executive powers subject to oversight from the homeland. Taxes and levies are collected by the colonial government and a portion flows back to the royal treasury. The governor corresponds with the monarch. However, communication can be sporadic as the the sea voyage lasts for months.

#### Culture
Steorrian society values order, industry, and exploration. Art, architecture, traditions, and stories are largely shaped by these principles. Ritual celebrations, marked by grand feasts, infuse vibrancy into daily routines. These communal events serve not only as occasions for merriment but also as expressions of the Kingdom's collective identity, all under the watchful gaze of the Unwavering Star.

The Church is a powerful institution within the Kingdom that acts as both custodian and interpreter of the Star’s will. Its teachings and doctrines guide the faithful, instilling a deep-seated belief in the divine connection between the Star and the destiny of Steorr. The Church generally sees magic as profane and an affront to the order established by the Star. The few people who are wield it are often seen with fear and distrust and blamed for all sort of evils. While not outright illegal, the use of magic is an aggravating circumstance for other perceived offences.

The desire to spread the Star’s message and Steorrian values have been instrumental in the Kingdom's ascent to prominence and expansion to the Islands. Magic being much more common in the Islands as it is in the Old Lands has caused tensions between Steorr and native inhabitants, who often practice magic openly. The Kingdom views cultural influences from Islanders as primitive and corrupting forces that could threaten Steorrian identity.

#### Foreign relations in the Islands

Clashing ideals, religious differences, past wars, and thirst for resources stoke tensions between Steorr and other entities in the archipelago. 

Steorr views its ambitions in the Islands as a righteous undertaking to uplift primitive cultures and uses assimilation, religious conversion, and military power to expand. 

After years of war, Steorr still mistrusts the elves of Selvea due to their magic, military might, and superior knowledge of the land. Although trade has soothed suspicions of the Siblín Guilds, Steorr remains weary of the wealth and economic influence the Siblín Guilds wield.

### Church of the Unwavering Star
organisation directing the worphsip of the [[Unwavering Star]] 

Their religious symbol is an eight-pointed star. The church of the Unwavering Star is an important faction within the Kingdom and the religion is used as a motivation to expand.

The state religion of Steorr ([[Steorr]]) and its colony is the worship of the Unwavering Star, a dark celestial body . 
The Church of the Unwavering Star is an influential institution within the Kingdom. Steorr ([[Steorr]]) wants to extend its colonies and enforce worship of the Star.

The Star shines above the city of Star Point. By following it in the sky, explorers from the [[Steorr]] discovered the Islands. The discovery of this land of plenty was seen as proof that the Star was on Steorr ([[Steorr]])'s side

The Kingdom of Steorr is looking to convert the indigenous people of the archipelago to their religion or ideology. The colony could be used as a base for missionaries, who would seek to spread the kingdom's beliefs and practices among the native inhabitants.

### Rebellion
##### Overview
Some nobles based in the Steorrian cities of [[Star Point]] and [[Sealtham]] have a secret plot to rebel against the Crown ([[Steorr]]). Those include the mayors of both cities, [[Lady Mayor Theis]] and [[Lord Mayor Brummbär]] respectively. Unsatisfied whit the lack of say in the Steorrian politics and lack of support from the kingdom despite their major economic contribution, they are planning for their provinces to become independent from Steorr, and even possibly wrest control of the whole Colony from the Kingdom. They have an intricate plot ([[Rebellion plot]]) to gain military advantage.

### Steorrian Colony
The Steorrian Island Colony operates under a complex administrative structure designed to govern its territories effectively. This system is characterized by a clear hierarchy and significant consolidation of power among key officials.

1. Colonial Level

At the apex of the colonial administration sits the Governor of the Steorrian Island Colony. Appointed directly by the Steorrian monarch, the Governor wields broad executive powers and is responsible for the overall administration of the entire colonial territory. The Governor resides in New Bæcon, the colonial capital on the Grand Isle.

The Governor corresponds with the monarch and royal council, providing updates on colonial affairs and receiving directives. They oversee the collection of taxes and levies, ensuring a portion flows back to the royal treasury in Steorr.

2. Island Level

Beneath the Governor are the Stewards, one for each major island under Steorrian control:

- Steward of Grand Isle
- Steward of Jagged Isle
- Steward of Crater Isle

The role of Steward is largely symbolic. They represent the crown's authority on their respective islands but have limited practical administrative powers. Stewards serve as figureheads and liaisons between the island's population and the colonial government.

3. Provincial Level

The practical administration of larger islands falls to the Prefects. Each Prefect is responsible for governing a specific region or province within an island. Examples include:

- Prefect of Western Grand Isle
- Prefect of Eastern Grand Isle
- Prefect of Northern Jagged Isle
- Prefect of Southern Jagged Isle

4. City Level

At the local level, Mayors govern individual cities and large towns. Key examples include:

- Mayor of New Bæcon
- Mayor of Star Point
- Mayor of Sealtham

Mayors are responsible for the day-to-day governance of their respective urban centers, answering to the higher levels of colonial administration.

Power Consolidation

A key feature of this administrative structure is the consolidation of power, where individuals often hold multiple titles and responsibilities across different levels of governance. For example:

- The Governor also serves as:
  - Prefect of the Old Coast province on the Grand Isle
  - Mayor of New Bæcon

- The Mayor of Star Point also serves as:
  - Prefect of the Point province in Eastern Grand Isle

- The Mayor of Sealtham doubles as:
  - Prefect of the Salt Peaks province in the Jagged Isle

This consolidation of titles streamlines governance and concentrates authority, reducing the number of individual power centers and allowing for more efficient decision-making.

Hierarchy:

Governor of the Steorrian Island Colony
↓
Stewards of Islands (symbolic roles)
↓
Prefects of Provinces
↓
Mayors of Cities

It's important to note that while this hierarchy exists, the consolidation of roles means that in practice, the lines between these levels can be blurred, with powerful individuals wielding authority across multiple levels simultaneously.

Territorial Extent

Steorrian control is primarily concentrated on three main islands:
- Grand Isle
- Jagged Isle
- Crater Isle

This administrative framework provides the Steorrian Island Colony with a clear chain of command while allowing for the concentration of power necessary to govern a diverse and geographically dispersed colonial territory.

Certainly! Let's break down the responsibilities for each level of administration in more detail:

1. Governor of the Steorrian Island Colony
Responsibilities:
- Implementing overall colonial policy as directed by the Crown
- Coordinating between the colony and the homeland
- Managing relations with other colonial powers and major native groups
- Overseeing the colonial budget and major economic decisions
- Making final decisions on colony-wide laws and regulations
- Commanding the colonial military forces
- Appointing Stewards and other high-level officials

2. Steward of [Island Name]
Responsibilities:
- Overseeing the administration of their entire island or island group
- Implementing the Governor's policies at the island level
- Managing island-specific resources and industries
- Coordinating between different provinces on their island
- Handling island-level disputes and legal matters
- Overseeing island-specific infrastructure projects
- Managing relations with local native groups
- Reporting to the Governor on the state of their island

3. Prefect of [Province Name]
Responsibilities:
- Administering a specific region within a larger island
- Enforcing colonial and island-level laws and regulations
- Managing local resources and overseeing smaller-scale industries
- Collecting taxes and maintaining financial records for their province
- Overseeing local infrastructure and development projects
- Resolving local disputes and maintaining order
- Coordinating with mayors of cities within their province
- Reporting to their island's Steward

4. Mayor of [City Name]
Responsibilities:
- Governing a specific city or large town
- Managing city services (e.g., sanitation, local law enforcement)
- Overseeing city-specific laws and regulations
- Managing the city budget and local taxes
- Coordinating with the local Prefect on larger issues
- Representing the city's interests to higher levels of government
- Handling day-to-day administration and citizen concerns

This structure allows for a clear division of responsibilities while also creating potential areas of overlap and conflict. For example:

- A Steward might disagree with the Governor about how to implement a particular policy on their island.
- A Prefect might struggle to balance the demands of their Steward with the needs of the mayors in their province.
- A Mayor might petition the Prefect or even the Steward directly for resources or support, potentially causing tension.

These intersections of authority and responsibility can create interesting dynamics for your campaign, allowing for political maneuvering, conflicting loyalties, and complex decision-making at all levels of colonial administration.
