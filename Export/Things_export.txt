### Green Salt
Green salt is a mineral that grows in the mountains of the [[Jagged Isle]]. It is mined, refined, traded by the [[Green Salt Trading Company]].
### Hagroot
Hagroot is an plant native to the island of Helis. Its leaves are used to flavour dished but its root has euphoric and hallucinogenic properties. In Helis, it plays an important role in shamanistic rituals, rites of passage, and some recreational events among the ruling classes.

However Siblin authorities regard it as a dangerous drug and strictly forbid trafficking hagroot into their territory. For years, Yazim and Esmith smuggled processed hagroot from Helis suppliers to distribute across the Siblins through their covert network.

Hagroot is a toxic greyish root that can only thrive when nourished by the 
p  Skilled herbalists and alchemists who partner with the carefully process hagroot roots into two forms - one an addictive recreational euphoric drug, the other a rare and expensive spice prized by nobles for its robust flavor profile. Eating unprocessed raw hagroot invariably leads to convulsions, organ failure, and death within hours. Even the refined drug poses dangers - overuse can trap users in an endless spiral of dependence, despair, and disturbing waking nightmares potentially ending in suicide. Despite periodic crackdowns, contraband hagroot continues circulating in the criminal underworlds of port cities across the islands.
