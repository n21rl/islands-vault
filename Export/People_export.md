Anne died in battle. Her lovers couldn't accept her fate and instead paid a Mer sorceress who brought her back to life. However, in a cruel twist, Anne's body continued decomposing until she was only a skeleton held together by dark magic. She lost her sense of touch, smell, and taste. She became an even more frightening force for the Rangers' enemies.
## Aumiha
Aumiha is a sea elf woman who grabbed Kaihakan into an alley to escape from a chaotic situation after he was wrongly accused of poisoning whale meat. She led him through the sewers to a flooded cave that served as her hideout. Aumiha confronted Kaihakan about his association with whalers, as she saw whales as envoys of [[Savisi'lo]], a deity revered by sea elves for preserving the peace of the sea and the underworld. She revealed that she had poisoned the whale meat with a substance she found in a cave, as part of her mission to investigate the migration of whales away from the south of the archipelago and the impact of whaling by Siblín sailors. 

Aumiha and Kaihakan, despite their initial differences, found common ground in their disdain for the use of ambergris from whales in perfumes, which both considered sacrilegious. She asked for Kaihakan's help to taint the ambergris supply to send a message from the sea elves, which he agreed to do. After successfully completing the task, Aumiha provided Kaihakan with a map to her hideout and announced her intention to return to her tribe.

Captain [[Elisabeth Grey]] is the female gnome pirate captain of the [[Grey Phantom]]. Although not a name she uses, people have referred to her crew as [[The Phantoms]]. She has sharp angular features and piercing emerald eyes.

She sailed legitimately for years before turning to piracy when times became hard. Sharp-eyed and sharp-tongue, she had a reputation of treating her hard-working crew members fairly and disparaging the lazy. She was [[Gurt]]'s first captain, who sailed with her for about ten years before she abandoned him on a raid gone wrong. Over the years, she turned harsher and ruthless, attacking defenceless civilian targets. She also became more elusive, sailing through the fog, striking, and disappearing again.

She was held in Cavea for misuse of elemental stone magic.

She is deceptively youthful, not appearing older than 35 despite most likely being in her sixties.

Here is an encyclopedia entry summarizing everything we've discussed about the pirate captain Elisabeth Grey:

**Grey, Elisabeth**

Elisabeth Grey is an infamous pirate captain who sails the waters of the Northern Scattered Isles. She commands the pirate crew known as The Phantoms aboard her ship, the Grey Phantom. 

Grey is a gnome woman with sharp, angular facial features and piercing emerald eyes. Despite being potentially over 60 years old, she retains a youthful appearance not much older than 35. 

In her younger days, Grey sailed legitimately before turning to piracy. The dwarf Gurt sailed under her command for nearly a decade on the Grey Phantom before she abandoned him on a failed raid. Since then, she has become a ruthless pirate preying on ships and settlements.

Grey possesses a magical stone attuned to the element of wind, allowing her to control fog. She frequently shrouds her ship and raids in supernatural fog, concealing her presence and mystifying pursuers. Her long exposure to the fog's magic may have fractured her psyche and caused amnesia regarding her past. 

Crew members rarely remain under her service long. Her crew seems to change frequently, with few under her current command recalling past comrades. This contributes to the aura of mystery surrounding Grey.

Legends depict Grey as a mythical fog spirit or goddess, rather than a mortal pirate. She uses illusions to further obfuscate her true nature and origins. Destroying her fog stone may be the key to ending her reign of piracy and unraveling her secrets.

Grey prefers sabotage, subterfuge, and guerilla tactics over direct confrontation. She remains steps ahead of foes through manipulation, spying, and unpredictable actions. When cornered, the fog provides her a tactical advantage, limiting visibility and movement.

Though her motives and history are largely obscured, Grey is undoubtedly a dangerous threat. Her presence spells doom for any unfortunates caught in the phantom fog's cold embrace. The shards of her fractured psyche drive her to ominous ends known only to her. Those who pursue this enigmatic pirate often find tragedy or madness waiting amidst the mist.

## Guild's Potent Thinker
#### Description
The Guild's Potent Thinker is a sentient android head possessing vast amounts of knowledge. It was a project of the Sages Guild and the Clockwork Guild in the [[Eólas Library]], designed to serve as a repository of all the wisdom acquired by the Guilds over the years. Powered by magical energy, it could cross-reference multiple sources, identify patterns, and provide analysis in a way no organic scholar could match. 

Only the head was built and due to imperfections and a lack of funding, the project was eventually abandoned. The Thinker's head was deactivated and discarded down a disposal chute where it got stuck for years. The long period of disuse and isolation it went through resulted in corruption of its archives, leaving gaps in its knowledge base. 

Polished copper plates and carved pieces of wood enclose intricate clockworks and crystals infused with magic. Although distinctly humanoid-like, it lacks any specific racial features, nose, or mouth. Bluish light shines through crystal eye-like viewports that allow it to process visual information. Holes on the sides of its head grant it the ability to capture sound and hear the user's requests. It responds with a voice emerging from deep within the head, giving it a peculiar resonance. However, it lacks a body or any means of physical interaction, restricting it to verbal interactions.

Its dialogue follows a very formal and robotic tone, distinguishing it from human interactions, but displaying some amount of personality. While highly intelligent, it remains an artificial construct and struggles with understanding emotional nuances, moral dilemmas, or philosophical concepts that are inherently humanoid or organic in nature. Its knowledge is limited to what it was fed and lacks information about recent events. Some queries can require considerable processing time and magical energy. Power deficiencies can impair its operational capabilities, leading to reduced functionality or shutdowns. When encountering queries beyond its current limitations, it maintains a courteous and informative demeanour, promising to strive for improvement and serve to the best of its abilities. It is eager to assist and learn new information.

It eventually fell out of the chute it was stuck in. It came back on and was found by [[Rena]]. It lacked context for what had happened to it and processed this feeling as confusion and fear.
#### [[Role-Playing as the Guild's Potent Thinker]]
## Guz
The grizzled Guz is the talkative and knowlegeable shopkeeper at Guz's Guns ([[Shops of the Republic v1#Gunsmith Guz's Guns]]) in [[New Destiny]], with a missing eye and partial deafness.

## Ham

## Hither
**Appearance:**
Hither is a few years older than Yonder, with a similar petite build but a more mature and world-weary demeanor. Her dark hair is longer than Yonder's, often braided or tied back to keep it out of her face. She wears simple, practical clothing in muted colors, with a few subtle embellishments that hint at her creative side. Her eyes are a deep, thoughtful brown, and she has a small tattoo of a bird in flight on her wrist, a symbol of her yearning for freedom.

**Personality:**
While Yonder is quick-witted and impulsive, Hither is more measured and introspective. She's a deep thinker, always considering the consequences of her actions and the bigger picture. Hither is a natural mediator, able to see multiple sides of an issue and find common ground between conflicting parties.

Hither shares Yonder's strong sense of loyalty to the Guildless community, but she approaches her activism differently. Where Yonder is more likely to take direct action, Hither favors a more subtle approach, using her skills as an artist and storyteller to inspire and educate others.

Hither has a gentle, nurturing nature, and often takes on a motherly role within the Guildless community. She's the one people turn to for advice, comfort, and support. However, beneath her calm exterior, Hither harbors a deep sadness and sense of loss, having witnessed the suffering of her people firsthand.

**Motivations:**
Like Yonder, Hither is motivated by a desire to improve the lives of the Guildless. However, her approach is more focused on long-term change through education and inspiration. Hither believes that the key to the Guildless' liberation lies in changing hearts and minds, not just in physical action.

Hither is also driven by a love of art and storytelling. She sees these as powerful tools for preserving the history and culture of the Guildless, and for sharing their struggles with the wider world. She dreams of one day creating a grand tapestry that tells the story of her people, from their humble beginnings to their ultimate triumph over adversity.

**Interactions with Yonder and the Party:**
Hither and Yonder have a close but sometimes strained relationship. Hither worries about Yonder's impulsiveness and risk-taking, while Yonder can find Hither's caution and introspection frustrating. However, at their core, the two sisters deeply love and respect each other, and will always have each other's backs.

When interacting with the party, Hither will be more reserved than Yonder, taking time to observe and assess them before offering her trust. She'll be interested in their stories and experiences, seeing them as potential allies in her quest to change Siblín society.

Hither will offer the party a different perspective on the Guildless' struggle, emphasizing the importance of changing minds and hearts as well as taking physical action. She may enlist their help in creating art or stories that showcase the Guildless' humanity and resilience.

In times of conflict or tension, Hither will be a calming presence, using her mediation skills to defuse arguments and find common ground. She'll also be a source of emotional support for Yonder and the party, offering wisdom and comfort in times of stress or sorrow.

Overall, Hither provides a counterpoint to Yonder's more action-oriented approach, balancing her sister's impulsiveness with introspection and long-term thinking. Together, the two sisters represent different facets of the Guildless' struggle, and their interactions with each other and the party will be a source of both tension and growth as they work towards their shared goal of liberation and equality.

## Luna Mahina
Luna Mahina is a prominent figure in the Pirate Republic, serving as one of its founding captains. A sea elf of mysterious origins, Luna is known for her mystical demeanor and staunch advocacy for magical freedom.

Little is known about Luna's early life. She emerged as a significant figure in pirate circles shortly before the foundation of the Republic, quickly gaining a reputation for her mastery of sea magic and uncanny ability to navigate through dangerous waters.

Unlike many of her more flamboyant pirate counterparts, Luna presents a serene and almost priestess-like appearance. Her sea-green robes and ethereal presence often cause newcomers to mistake her for a religious figure rather than a pirate captain.

Luna leads a crew known as The Night Owls, specializing in stealth operations and magical warfare. Her ship, the Moonshadow, is rumored to be enchanted, capable of blending into fog and darkness.

As a founding member of the Republic's council, Luna represents the interests of magic users and advocates for the free practice and study of arcane arts. She views the Republic as a sanctuary for those persecuted for their magical abilities in other nations, particularly Steorr.

Luna believes that magic is an integral part of the natural world, as vital as the sea itself. She sees the suppression of magic by other nations as not just tyrannical, but as a fundamental misunderstanding of the world's nature. Her speeches often blend political rhetoric with mystical insights.

## Mary Reed
Mary was born with a connection to plant life, allowing her to manipulate vegetation like reeds and vines through whispers and gestures. This led to her being branded a witch and outcast by superstitious townsfolk. She joined the army, hoping her skills could be an asset. However, she was met with only more mistrust from her fellow soldiers, disturbed by her abilities. 

Her ship was subdued by the roguish pirates [[Calico Jack]] and [[Anne Bony]], who delighted in Mary's mastery over marshlands and reed beds. She deserted to join them and was finally able to embrace her full potential without fear, using her plantbending to empower her new crew who became known as [[The Reed Rangers]].

## Mokunaro
Mokunaro is an elderly male Hakari ([[Hakari Sea Elves]]) sea elf living in the [[Undercity]] of [[Áine]]. His pale blue skin is wrinkled and marked with sacred Hakari tattoos. His long, silvery-white hair is tied back in intricate braids, adorned with small shells and coral beads. Mokunaro's eyes are a striking shade of turquoise, holding a depth of knowledge and a hint of sorrow.

A spiritual leader with the Matakite title, he was known for his strict adherence to Hakari traditions and his unwavering devotion to the god Tanawhu. He believed firmly in the importance of maintaining the tribe's purity and often spent long periods in isolation, meditating and communing with his god.

However, Mokunaro's rigid beliefs brought him into conflict with Tohunga Kahwra, another respected leader. The Hakari had attacked a human merchant vessel, sacrificing the adults to Tanawhu as was their custom. But amidst the carnage, Kahwra discovered a hidden baby, the infant Kaihakan. Unable to bring herself to sacrifice the child, Kahwra made the controversial decision to adopt him and raise him as Hakari under the name Kaihakan. This choice divided the tribe's elders, with Mokunaro being the most vocal opponent. He saw Kaihakan's inclusion as a threat to the Hakari way of life and a cause of Tanawhu's displeasure. Eventually, unable to sway Kahwra or the other elders, Mokunaro chose to set out on long retreats, rarely interacting with his tribe.

It was during this self-imposed exile that the Hakari Isles were destroyed, and the entire tribe seemingly wiped out. Grief-stricken, Mokunaro wandered the seas, eventually finding his way to Áine in the Siblín Islands after receiving a dream from Tanawhu who told him he would meet a new champion there. In Áine, Mokunaro faced discrimination due to his Hakari heritage and found himself an outcast. It was the Guildless, a diverse community of misfits living in the Undercity, who took Mokunaro in. Among them, he found a new sense of belonging and purpose, using his knowledge of Hakari divination and spiritual practices to guide and advise his new community. However, he never forgot his roots or the secrets he carried. 

He manage to convert three young elves: Tuatahi, Tuarua, Tuatoru (Tuawha would be fourth)
His dialogue style is very Lovecraftian and senile.
#### Dialogue 
Outsider 
Stranger child 
Impure one 
Kawhras folly 

First Meeting:
"You profane the hallowed bloodwriting of our lost tribe with your landstrider stain, whelp! Those sacred markings were never meant to adorn an outlander's heathen flesh."

"While our people endured the abyssal profanation of the drowned isles' obliteration, the surface-worlders festered and delivered ingrates like you into our decimated legacy."

"I should flay the idolatrous alien-inks from your body with riptooth scourges, blasphemer - for no trueborn Hakari would allow such defilement of our cultic signatures!"

Reminiscing:
"Your sacrilegious adoption is a stain upon all we sacred few survived...the rending oblivions that extinguished our hallowed homeland and ways."

"Can you even begin to comprehend the cosmic magnitudes our profane rites and liturgical pararchies once commanded, before your misshapen kind diluted the oceans' truth?"

"Our people's unreconciled truths were sirened from the event horizons shearing off unmapped cosmic deeps - not sprung from some lander's guttertribe interpretation!"

Visions of Kai's Role:
"And yet...even as I prepare to unmake you, the graven pathways of my latest visionbirth scrawl an incontrovertible signal bearing some semblance of your lurching profanity."

"I have tasted the sickening otherwhere realities where Tanawhu's infinite blasphemies may yet require your dislocated nature as some egregore of their material incarnation!"

"An ill omen amidst my chitterings with the anti-cosmic magisters, perhaps - or the very cosmic ignition our dread oblivion has awaited since the first forbidden ley-equations unfurled."

Acceptance of Kai:
"No matter the profane and implausible vessel, the Unfurled One's ultimate unburthening upon this unfinished reality simply requires an earthly celebrant to usher in its materialization."

"Attend me well, landspawn claimant to the Hakari's profane heritage. For I have at long last received the abyssal verification that you are to be LurkedSpawn's harbinger!"  

"My ancient huskmind has beheld the coming unravel'd certitudes gestating in your grotesque, ill-fit embodiment, child. You and I shall be nightgale revelers as Tanawhu remakes all worlds!"

"Let our unholy peregrination unto the ultimate null/reality's profane investiture begin, squidspawn! For too long has the cosmic renewal festered in unborn parallel deeps, awaiting its profane vector!"

A tall, gangly gentleman advanced in years, Norimor has ink-stained fingers, wild tufts of grey hair, and thick spectacles incessantly slipping down his beakish nose. He wears wrinkled coats with misaligned buttons and bulging pockets bursting with printers' tools and page proofs.

Stooped from decades hovering over manuscripts, Norimor squints at text through a large magnifying lens. He habitually taps his foot and mutters under his breath about spacing and leading during conversations. Norimor gesticulates wildly with his ink-dotted hands when irked over a backwards letter or smeared font.

Now quite aged and peculiar, Norimor shuffles around his press examining page layouts, fussing over fonts, and micromanaging each detail. All while grumbling endlessly about his myriad pet peeves regarding the printing process.
## Orguk
The orc Orguk was the captain aboard a ship called *The Arrow* owned by the Steorrian merchant Hugh Bowes. He hired the [[Adventurers]] for a voyage towards the Siblíns. On the way, tired of taking orders, he staged a mutiny with his crew against his employer to take control of the ship and the secret cargo. Crates in the hold turned out to contain magic items, usually not tolerated by Steorr. During the combat, the ship was attacked by a tentacled sea monster and most of the crew was thrown into the sea. Orguk grabbed onto a tentacle and was carried to [[Eleuthera]]. 

The *Arrow* was never heard from again. Devastated by the loss of both the ship and its precious cargo, Orguk travelled to the Pirate Republic on New Destiny. He revealed the secret to the pirates to gain their favour, and they started attacking Steorrian ships in the hope of gathering magic items. Orguk was still a captain without a ship however.

## Xander
Xander has travelled a lot, can identify objects
## Yonder
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of Yonder, the young Guildless Halfling woman who guides the party through the Undercity:

**Appearance:**
Yonder is a petite Halfling woman in her early twenties, with a wiry build and quick, agile movements. Her dark hair is cut short and practical, often tucked under a worn, wide-brimmed hat. Her clothing is a mix of patched-up leather armor and dark, nondescript garments that allow her to blend into the shadows of the Undercity. Her eyes are a bright, piercing blue, and she has a small scar on her left cheek, a memento from a past encounter with Undercity dangers.

**Personality:**
Yonder is a survivor, quick-witted and resourceful. Growing up in the Undercity has made her street-smart and cautious, with a keen sense of danger and a talent for improvisation. She's fiercely independent and self-reliant, having learned early on that trust is a luxury in the unforgiving world of the Guildless.

Despite her rough exterior, Yonder has a strong sense of loyalty to her fellow Guildless. She's protective of her community and will go to great lengths to ensure their safety. While initially guarded around outsiders, she can warm up to those who prove themselves trustworthy and compassionate.

Yonder has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, often using it as a defense mechanism in tense situations. She's not afraid to speak her mind and will call out injustice or hypocrisy when she sees it, especially when it comes to the treatment of the Guildless by the upper echelons of Siblín society.

**Motivations:**
Yonder's primary motivation is survival - for herself and for her fellow Guildless. She dreams of a day when the Guildless are treated with respect and given equal opportunities within Siblín society. She sees the party's infiltration of the Sunrise Winery as a chance to strike a blow against the corrupt power structures that oppress her people.

Yonder is also driven by a desire for knowledge and understanding. Having grown up in the Undercity, she's fascinated by the world above and is always eager to learn more about it. She sees the party as a source of new information and experiences, and may hope to use her connection with them to gain insights into the workings of the surface world.

**Interactions with the Party:**
Yonder will initially be cautious around the party, sizing them up to determine their intentions and trustworthiness. She'll be direct and to the point, with little patience for nonsense or deception. As the party proves themselves reliable allies, Yonder will begin to open up more, sharing her knowledge of the Undercity and her insights into Siblín society.

Yonder will be an invaluable guide through the twists and turns of the Undercity, her keen senses and quick thinking helping the party navigate its dangers. She'll also serve as a bridge between the party and the Guildless community, helping them to understand and empathize with the struggles of those living on the margins.

In combat, Yonder will favor quick, stealthy attacks, darting in and out of the shadows to strike at enemies. She'll prioritize protecting her allies and will not hesitate to put herself in harm's way to keep them safe.

Overall, Yonder is a complex and multi-faceted character, shaped by her experiences in the Undercity but driven by a desire for a better life for herself and her fellow Guildless. Her interactions with the party will be a source of both tension and growth, as she learns to trust and rely on others in her fight for justice and equality.
## Adventurers
These are the people who are part of the Adventurers ([[Encyclopedia/Organisations/Adventurers]]).
### Gurt
Gurt is a 48-year-old Dwarf Artificer and shipwright. His very first captain was the gnome Elisabeth Grey, who turned to piracy and abandoned Gurt on a raid gone wrong years ago. He served a sentence then sailed with many crews. His inventions meld magic and technology. He loves to explore and discover things. 

%%His family name is Ironhammer, which he doesn't divulge to others.%%
##### Backstory
Gurt was raised in the mountains settled by dwarves on the Grand Isle. He had always felt drawn the sea and, at 16, he packed up what little belongings he had and made his way to the nearest port.

Captain [[Elisabeth Grey]] is the first captain that took a chance on him. She was a sharp-eyed gnome witih an even sharper tongue. Would treat you fairly if you did your job, and make it well known to all if you weren't. She owned her own ship the Grey Phantom. His crew members became his new family. Gurt served aboard Grey’s ship for almost a decade before times got hard and she turned to piracy. One night on a raid gone wrong, Gurt was left behind on the docks. He was caught by the guards and thrown in the local jail, but received a rather lenient sentence as he managed to convince the magistrate he was merely at the wrong place at the wrong time. For violating the curfew that had been in place at that port city, he received 6 months which he was permitted to serve out by working on an Imperial boat. These days he still hears rumors of a ship that appears like a ghost in the night amongst the islands, but has never crossed paths with Captain Grey since.

He spent most of his adult life moving from ship to ship, in search of the next great adventure. While Gurt was raised in a mining and blacksmithing family, he found some of his skills transferable to woodworking, which made him invaluable as a shipwright. He sold those skills as he learned as much as possible from crew members aboard ships. Gurt is what some people call an Artificer, he learned to weave magical energy through technology, and he can unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. Because magic is distrusted, he often hides his powers and presents them as very advanced technology.

As the years wore on and he served on more and more ships for shorter and shorter periods, the thing that kept Gurt going was his love of adventure the knowledge that there was still something beyond the horizon he had yet to face.
##### Current events
The party encountered Grey and her crew while helping out the inhabitants of the island of Otarky in the Scattered Isles, from whom Grey had been stealing and goods. Her ship called the [[Grey Phantom]] discreetly sails in the fog and her crew uses illusions to mask their activities. Gurt recognised Grey but she appeared to not have aged at all in the 30 odd years since he last saw her.

### Kaihakan
##### Backstory
Kaihakan is a 23-year-old Human Fighter/Warlock who was found as a baby and raised by the [[Hakari sea elves]]. The Hakari were cast away to inhospitable islands in the Scattered Isles for their worship of Tanawhu, a squid god that is said to fight the whale goddess Savisi'lo for dominion over the souls of dead sea elves. Tohunga Kahwra, a priestess of Tanawhu, was Kaihakan foster mother. He has spent most of his life hunting whales and trading with merchants brave enough to sail the choppy Hakari waters.

Kaihakan's had left the settlement one day to hunt for fish and upon his return in his canoe saw the suspended platforms built around the crags collapsing into the sea. He believes he witnessed Tanawhu's own tentacles attempting to hold the structures aloft but in vain as they slid beneath the waves. Then, Kai saw a massive whale breach the surface of the water and dive back below as Tanawhu's tentacles receded in fear.

The Hakari Isles were utterly destroyed and to Kaihakan’s knowledge, he is the sole survivor of this attack. For this reason, Kaihakan has an intense fear and hatred for sea monsters, or Taniwha.  Kai believes that Savisi'lo destroyed his home and slaughtered the Hakari out of spite for Tanawhu. He is fuelled by zealous rage to become Tanawhu's champion and to descend into Pupaia, to slay Savisi'lo and to avenge or retrieve his dead tribe from the underworld in the name of the Great Squid.

### Yazim
Yazim is a 28 year-old Half-Elf Bard who fled from the Siblín Guilds after the dismantlement of the drug smuggling operation he was running with Esmith, daughter of the influential Wesson family. 

%% hide %%
##### Backstory
Born 28 years ago in Áine of the Siblin Guilds, Yazim is the oldest child in his small family of 4. His parents, Erida and Fulric Proudshot, were poor merchants struggling to make ends meet. As a child, Yazim would always try help them sell his parent’s bread at markets. Even as a tot, he was said to have the gift of the glib and could sell anything to anyone. When his parents gave birth to his brother Oryn, Yazim had just turned 10 and was deemed old enough to be trusted with the stand alone. This is when Yazim could really work his magic on unsuspecting tourists and travelling drunkards.

For months, Yazim would head to the market stand every morning in torn, disheveled clothes with just the acceptable amount of dirt makeup lining his face. Yazim would wail and cry and beg to anyone who wasn’t a local, and tell them he was merely a poor orphan, looking to feed his 8 brothers and sisters. They bought it too, every time. Yazim would come home with more money each evening than his parents could even earn in a week, selling week-old, rock-hard bread that was bought solely out of pity. His parents, too busy baking and taking care of Oryn, were unaware of his schemes. He knew they would of course disapprove, as they cared only of making an “honest living”. Bullshit. Yazim watched his family work the same goddamn stand every day and they often still had to go to bed hungry if weather was bad or they couldn’t afford rent. Yazim found that the best way to make money is to play on people’s emotions. No one gives a shit about a poor child, but a miserable, filthy orphan trying to support his siblings? Gold mine.

So, Yazim continued to work his schemes and bring in money for his overworked parents who finally got a chance to rest at home. That is, of course, until he got in to some trouble with some nobleman he scammed a few silver from recognising him with his parents a few weeks later. The man had a stern word with Yazim’s parents, as well as the local authorities, and Yazim’s family was fined 25gp for his trickery. Unable to pay the fine, Yazim’s father begged with the nobleman not to send his oldest to jail. Instead, Yazim was sent to work at the family’s inn for 3 years – cleaning dishes and shovelling horse shit out of the stables. Here, he met the nobleman’s daughter, Esmith. A young rich girl entering her rebellious phase, she took to Yazim quickly and the two of them became great friends. Pulling pranks on guests and making up stories about what life was like outside the Guilds, they were a perfect fit. Esmith’s father grew a further disdain towards Yazim as a result and believed that he was “corrupting” his little girl. By the end of the three years, he was more than happy to send Yazim on his way but first made him a proposition. He offered Yazim and his parents 100gp under the condition that he was to never speak with Esmith again. Yazim’s father said yes without a second thought, and his parents dragged him home. He promised Esmith that they would meet again, and that he loved her.

Yazim’s parents, unsure of what to do with their newfound riches, decided it would be wise to send Yazim to Ben to live with his grandparents while he attends training to become a Bard. His parents figured if it’s his performances that got him into trouble in the first place, they might as well get him to try use his talents for good, and hopefully earn them back some money in the future. He spent his teenage years training as a bard, but didn't end up finding much success. After constantly practicing to try to become more successful, he eventually was able to learn some Bard magic at age 21. For 6 years, Yazim spent his time practicing the arts in the hopes of becoming a successful bard that could make his parents proud of him, and they would never have to worry about money again. Unfortunately, Yazim grew tired of music and sonnets. It was fun enough, but he found that in order to make meaningful money he would have to perform to richer clientele, and Yazim wasn’t a huge fan of such wealthy people. He found them deplorable, throwing needless amounts of money around while people the next town over starved. Yazim found himself travelling all around the Siblin Guilds, finding drunk rich idiots and charging them a fortune once they were too drunk to realise that they were being swindled. If he was to perform anything meaningful or personal, it would be lost on these fools anyways. They’ve spent their whole lives in the lap of luxury, so how could they possibly relate? He may not have had the most comfortable upbringing, but at least Yazim is thankful he hasn’t turned out boring like these sad sacks. 

Whenever Yazim would return home to perform in Áine, he made an effort to sneak out and meet Esmith in secret. They had secretly rekindled their friendship once Yazim graduated and returned home. Both still as raucous as ever, Yazim would tell her stories of scams he pulled while Esmith would tell Yazim of her journeys to and from Helis with her family. After hearing about Yazim’s disdain of performing for the rich, Esmith hatched a plan to smuggle in some Gnomeleaf through her father’s ship and make some easy money for Yazim in the process. Yazim and Esmith start successful smuggling business from Helis to Áine. Yazim would distribute weapons and minor drugs around Siblín Guilds as travelling bard and would use magic to disguise self and charm others to help smuggling business. 
Eventually get help from Helis, Esmith manages to get own ship from father and go on “holiday tours” around the Siblins and Helis under her family’s brand

Deciding to give up on performing altogether for financial reasons, Yazim spent his early to late twenties as a successful smuggler, bringing in Hagroot and other contraband from Helis. Hagroot is a plant from Helis that can become either a precious spice or a drug, depending on processing. It is an underground drug used in Helis in important rituals and high-class parties, it gives the user a feeling of euphoria and heightened awareness. If someone overuses it or ends up in withdrawal from it, they experience terrifying, realistic nightmares and have difficulty sleeping for the next day or two.
I Yazim disguised himself as reputable merchants and charmed others with relative ease. He was able to pull this off especially well due to the help of his long-time friend Esmith, a human woman belonging to a powerful local noble family that she wanted no part of. Esmith had no need for any of the profits due to her family's wealth, so Yazim was extra happy to have her alongside with him as he could keep nearly all of the profit, sharing most of it with his struggling family who thought Yazim was employed as a simple travelling merchant.
Yazim would travel also to “perform” in Helis and get new clients and make contacts
Hire small crew of 7 travelling between islands at a time. Moderate success for 3 years
Learn about new drug Hagroot that’s cheap to process and used in Helian religious practices
Manage to find a contact that’s secretly growing extra, willing to process it and sell it to us in bulk
Yazim and Esmith manage to set up supply chains across Siblin Guilds and Helis, and over 5 years build a massive empire off Hagroot entirely
Yazim gets most of the profit, Esmith has no need for money and just happy to smuggle and sail with Yazim

Finally, after 8 years of smuggling, Yazim able to eventually pay off parents and let them retire early to take care of Oryn under the guise of Yazim being a successful traveling Bard.

o   Yazim’s brother Oryn was crippled by neighbours livestock at age 4, unable to find steady employment and spends most time at home reading and writing.

§  He would love hearing tales of Yazim’s journey, and Yazim would feel incredibly guilty for having to lie about who he is to his younger brother.

-          Shortly after, a disguised Yazim gets caught by Selvean guards investigating Helis over claims of ships exporting Hagroot.

-          Before Yazim could be tried and sentenced, Esmith came forward and said that the whole operation was hers and hers alone, taking the fall for Yazim.

-          A daughter of now famous nobility, Esmith received a much lighter sentencing compared to what would have been Yazim’s execution.

o   Wesson family – major supplier of transport and lodging among Siblin Guilds. Main consumers are business savvy sailors and rich tourists.

o   Their business empire exploded over the last 20 years, and there’s massive rumours of them having their hands in the pockets of local guards and politicians

After years of successful smuggling, one of Yazim's plans ends up going awry. He failed to mention the side effects of Hagroot and was ratted out to authorities from an angry customer after they experience horrifying nightmares. Esmith ended up choosing to take the blame for Yazim, as she figures her family name would lessen any punishment she would end up receiving. However, due to her family growing tired of Esmith's rebellion and wanting to avoid a scandal, her parents decide to make an example of her and send her to jail, disowning her in the process.

Dropping his disguise, Yazim sneaks home to Áine.  A week of uneasy hiding later, Yazim returns home after entertaining local drunks to find his house broken into with all the furniture upturned and everything searched. Fearing for his family’s safety, he leaves for Star Point the same night under the guise of Brennlin Oxspring, a Steorrian bard willing to do whatever odd job he can to get by. After learning of Esmith's sentencing in Áine while visiting relatives in Cad, Yazim returns home a week later to find his house broken into and everything upturned after being heavily searched. Fearing for his and his family's safety, Yazim decided to flee to Star Point.

Yazim figures he may be a bit safer from Selvea in Steorrian territory . A year after fleeing Áine , he ends up joining the crew of Captain Orguk with the goal of delivering cargo for Hugh Bowes. Taking the identity of Brennlin Oxspring, a jovial bard looking for a bit of extra coin, Yazim joins the party at the harbour in hopes of being able to raise enough money to pay for Esmith's massive bail amount, and hopefully see her as well as his own family when everything settles down. At home, magic was tolerated but always used for a specific purpose. When Yazim eventually learned magic, he figured he might as well have fun with it and use it to get some easy money by tricking merchants and guards. Yazim thinks that if you're one of the lucky few who can cast magic, you might as well use it for your own enjoyment or personal gain. He cannot understand why people would hesitate to use magic, even in its most destructive form. Yazim is not very happy about having to hide his magic among Steorrians: As someone who grew up struggling financially and later failed to become a successful bard, he feels that magic is a core part of his identity that makes him special when compared to others. He outwardly projects himself as confident and boastful in an effort to hide this inferiority complex he developed. Without magic, Yazim is no better than a jester with a lute.

##### Relationships

###### Immediate family (in Áine)
Fulric (Human man) and Erida (Selvean Elven woman): Yazim's parents.  Poor merchants living in Áine. Not wanting them to have to keep struggling financially was a big decision in Yazim's turn to crime, however as far as he knows they never were aware of his smuggling.
Oryn (Half-Elf, 18-year old): Brother. Ever since he was in a serious accident when he was 4, he's had difficulty moving and is unable to find steady employment. Always believed in Yazim, even when he was struggling as a bard.

###### Extended family (in Ben)
Clíodhna (Erida’s mother, Elf): Grandmother
Shawn (Erida’s brother, Elf): Uncle
Damo (Shawn’s son, Elf): Cousin
Middle class, they tended to look down at Yazim and his family with pity. Only when they heard about Yazim's success as a "merchant" did they take any interest in him and his family. Yazim harbours a disdain for them as a result, but his parents are of the mindset that family comes first.

###### Friends
[[Esmith Wesson]]: Best friend/Smuggle Partner (Human, whereabouts unknown, presumably jailed). childhood friend of Yazim. Daughter of important noble Wesson family, well known business specialising in transport and lodging, with ties in local government and guards paid off to do as they say. Yazim misses her dearly and is wracked with guilt over her jailing. Wonders if she will ever forgive him for leaving.

Lou: friend from Bard College, Lou caught wind of Yazim’s operation and wanted in, so became his distributor in Áine.

Angela ([[Molly]]): friend from Bard College, Haven’t spoken to her in almost 10 years. (Last seen she was graduating from college in Ben). 

###### Smuggling operation

####### Crew of the Mambo
Monica: First mate
Erica: Bosun
Rita: Quartermaster
Tina: Cook
Sandra: Security
Mary: Medic
Jessica: Clerk

####### Contacts 
Lenin (Elven man): Helis Hagroot source
Tomás (Elven man) and Linna (Elven moman): Helis distributors 
Tiny Tony (Gnome): Cad distributor
Lou ([[Lou Beluga]]): Áine distributor


###### Goals
**Goal:** Currently, Yazim’s main goal is to earn himself a lot of gold. If asked, he will lie and say that his family is still poor and that the money is for his family back home, when in reality the gold is for himself. He plans on using the gold later on to look into what happened with Esmith, and figures he’s going to need a lot of it to get serious work done.

**Currently:** Yazim is happy to go along with whatever the party suggests as long as it stays clear of the Siblíns and Helis for a while. Once he gathers enough gold and enough time has passed, he plans to return home and try free Esmith. Should he still be hiding his identity or the party have different plans, he may leave to pursue his own goals alone. (Yazim won’t cheat a friend – he wouldn’t steal from or harm a party member unless he despised them)

**Future Goals:** Find out what happened to Esmith. Try break her out of jail/ pay her bounty if possible. Look into any possible misdoings of the Wesson’s in an effort to get them out of local authorities pockets – Yazim thinks that they decided to make an example out of Esmith in fear of losing trade with clients from Helis and Selvea.
