## Act 1 - Mutiny
The party is hired by Orguk and stages a mutiny against ship owner Hugh Bowes. Attacked by a sea monster, they find themselves shipwrecked and discover they had been transporting magic items.

- Session 01 ([[Session 01]])
- Session 02 ([[Session 02]])
- Session 03 ([[Session 03]])
### Session 01
The party met on the main harbour of [[Star Point]], a major Steorrian city on the [[Grand Isle]]. Along with a young halfling named [[Bob]], they were hired to join the crew of Captain [[Orguk]]. The orc worked for the half-elf merchant [[Hugh Bowes]], who had been travelling with a [[Steorrian army]] escort, including the elven sergeant [[Elysia]]. The adventurers met [[Cook]], the Goliath cook and [[Kawrl]], the birdfolk lookout.

Shortly after setting sail towards the Siblín Islands, fed up with taking orders from Bowes, Orguk convinced the new hires to join him and his crew in taking control of the ship and its secret cargo. During the battle that ensued, the ship was attacked and destroyed by a sea monster.
### Session 02
The party found themselves beached on a small unmapped island ([[Fort Island]]), most likely somewhere in the [[Northern Scattered Isles]]. They were confronted by Bowes ([[Hugh Bowes]]) and his escort composed of [[Elysia]] and Steorrian soldiers ([[Steorrian army]]), who had taken [[Bob]] hostage. Bowes ordered the party to recover a crate stolen by [[Orguk]]'s crew, who had been hiding in a ruined fort. The party was to also take control of the ship stationed within the fort's walls. 

After infiltrating the fort through a sea cave, the party made their way up, fighting undead Steorrian soldiers ([[Steorrian army]]) on the way. They freed an old [[Unnamed Mer Woman]] who apparently had been captured years ago. 

There was no sign of Orguk, but the party came across with the four crew members who had made it to the island: [[Cook]] the Goliath, [[Geera]] the half-orc, [[Muni]] the dwarf, [[Kawrl]] the crow-person. They decided to side with them. From the metal crate the crew had stolen, hidden under a layer of green salt, Brenlinn ([[Yazim]]) found a magical cloak.
### Session 03
The party devised a plan to rescue [[Bob]] and flee the island. Using grease, [[Gurt]] managed to lower the chain that was blocking the ship. Brenlinn ([[Yazim]]) tricked the merchant's team to approach the fort. [[Kaihakan]] fired a ballista bolt, killing the elven sergeant who seemed the biggest threat. The party, Bob, and the 4 other members of [[Crew]] escaped the island aboard the ship, leaving Bowes and his men stranded. 
The crew sailed for a few days and encountered a shimmering fog imbued with strange magical effects. Gurt aged down by about a year after traversing the fog. During the voyage, Brenlinn figured out that the cloak would help swim and breath underwater. While praying to his god, Kaihakan was grabbed by a watery tentacle, which awakened powers in him.
## Act 2 - Mystery in the Fog
The party investigates a haunted mansion in Otarkys and uncovers a smuggling operation.

- Session 04 ([[Session 04]])
- Session 05 ([[Session 05]])
- Session 06 ([[Session 06]])
### Session 04
As they approached an island, the party ([[Adventurers]]) was ambushed by another ship. After making it clear they meant no harm, the party met with [[Viktor]], the captain. He welcomed them to the island of [[Otarky]] and explained that his small town was seemingly cursed, and the local trade of mushroom-derived products wasn't thriving. Viktor asked the party to investigate the ruined house overlooking the town that used to belong to an alchemist. Many villagers thought it was haunted and the source of the town's bad luck. In exchange the party would receive goods they could trade. [[Kawrl]], who was hurt during the battle would be healed by [[Liv]], the local vet.

The party explored the house, and found no obvious signs of haunting. Instead, several enchantments produced sounds and illusions. The party found the corpse of [[Derrick]], Viktor's brother. They discovered a hidden way to the cellar, where two men tried to fight them off but were rapidly incapacitated. One of these men was [[Marius]], a mage specialising in illusion magic.
### Session 05
After gathering information about a lantern-based communication system, the party discovered secret passages to the old alchemist's lab and to sea caves below the house. They ventured further down under the house, coming across what was apparently the hideout of a group of smugglers who had been stealing goods in the region. The party killed several bandits but decided to retreat to the town when it looked like they would be overwhelmed.
### Session 06
[[Viktor]] had interrogated the captured smugglers and learned that the other half of gang operated from a ship that only approached in foggy weather. [[Gurt]] gathered that Viktor had killed [[Marius]] as revenge for his brother's life, but kept the secret. The hideout was empty when the party returned to the house.

Lanterns signals were sent form the house to the smugglers' ship when it was spotted, to make it drop anchor. [[Gurt]] and Brenlinn ([[Yazim]]) pretended to be members of the gang bringing merchandise aboard with a small rowboat. Approaching discreetly through the fog on the party's ship, [[Kaihakan]] jumped aboard to fight the smugglers. Gurt and Brenlinn managed to maintain the illusion for a while, taking down bandits with Kaihakan. Ultimately, they felt outmatched and decided to flee and sail back to town. As they were leaving, Gurt noticed the leader of the smugglers was a gnome woman he identified as Captain Grey ([[Elisabeth Grey]]), who he had sailed under years and years ago. She however did not seem much older.
## Act 3 - The Bird Curse
In Otarkyn, the party deals with a sea hag's bird curse involving a peryton and an egg.

- Session 07 ([[Session 07]])
- Session 08 ([[Session 08]])
- Session 09 ([[Session 09]])
### Session 07
As thanks for crippling the smugglers' operation, the party ([[Adventurers]]) received a flag of [[Otarky]] and mushroom cloth to sell north of the island. They transported [[Liv]], who had been asked for help by a merchant from the northern town. As they approached the town, they noticed a massive shape sink under water in the distance. 

On the harbour, an argument was ongoing between [[Sable Martes]], a merchant woman from the Siblín Guilds and the harbourmaster. Sable's sails had been torn to shreds by a flock of birds after her ship nearly got stuck in a mass of sargassum. The man was refusing to sell cloth to Sable, as trade had been poor in the area and the town inhabitants favoured the needs of their own ships. The party offered to sell their textile to Sable for a premium, which she accepted. Sable tried to learn of any trading opportunity from the adventurers, promising them shares in her new ventures, but they kept quiet. Brenlinn ([[Yazim]]) deftly stole a ring from Sable's finger. 

Suddenly, a young boy was attacked by swarms of gulls on the pier. The party protected him and learned that he was named [[Ham]]. He told them that his friends and him had found a large egg in the mushroom swamps after it fell out of the sky. Since, birds had been acting violently around town, going after children in particular. The adventurers went around town to look for [[Fipp]], Ham's friend who was currently in possession of the egg. They were unable to find him. Liv revealed that she could communicate with animals, and that a lone starling had told her a mysterious phrase: "Fetid blubber, seaweed, close the eye, set us free". 

The group met [[Master Powell]], an eccentric old man fascinated by lore and magic. His collection of magic items had recently been stolen and he suspected a group of Steorrians was responsible. He bought items, books, and even stories from the party. He did not have any obvious information to offer about the bird attacks.

During the night, the adventurers were woken up by a loud commotion. They found that a man had been murdered. His body was strangely mutilated, with marks from antlers, claws and fangs. His chest was ripped open, and his heart was missing. The house had been ransacked and large blue feathers littered the floor. A young girl was found hiding in a chest of drawers. It was [[Telmay]], Ham's friends who had been keeping the egg the day before Fipp. She had been staying with her uncle, the murdered man, as her parents were trading south. Telmay told the party she saw two large human shadows and heard two people talking as if they were a couple. They were looking for the egg. The woman told the man to look for her in the East, where the seabirds gather. The party ran to Master Powell's house with the clues they had found. The loremaster told them he would need the rest of the night to find relevant information in his large library.
### Session 08
The next morning, the party ([[Adventurers]]) met [[Fipp]]'s dads in the swamps where they were working. Fipp hadn't made it home the night before, but that wasn't unusual for him. One of Fipp's fathers said he saw a rowboat flying over the swamp. However, he was going through withdrawal from Hagroot, so hallucinations were to be expected. [[Gurt]] harvested a sample of shroomwood, and whittled a beak, the final piece for the large mechanical Northern Goose he had been building. He named his creation Godfrey. 

From his research, [[Master Powell]] had found that the creature responsible for the murder was most likely a male peryton, a monstrous hybrid of a deer and an eagle, with teeth as sharp as a wolf’s. These violent beasts are particularly fond of humanoid hearts and their shadows are said to take the shape of their last human victim. For this reason, some believe that perytons have a kind of human aspect. A powerful magic user could perform an ancient ritual to transform a peryton into a human by transferring the monstrous essence of the beast into the body of a fledgling peryton. Only the human part would remain in the adult, while the young would be doomed to a painful violent existence. The egg found by the children matched the description of a peryton egg and could therefore be a the centre of this ritual. 

The party made their way to the town square, where a meeting to discuss the bird attacks was to take place. They met with [[Ham]] and his friends, and Fipp handed the egg over to the party. The party devised a clever diversion: Brenlinn ([[Yazim]]) created a magical duplicate of the egg and [[Kaihakan]] hid the real one in their bag of holding. Soon before the meeting was about to start, a large murmuration of starlings formed an eyed in the sky over the square. A woman’s voice, seemingly carried by the birds, filled the air and accused the town of thievery. The starlings then swooped down on the townsfolk, sowing chaos. A large male peryton flew in as well, attacking innocent bystanders in search of the egg. The party fought valiantly, joined by [[Bob]] and [[Muni]], who were on shore leave. After an arduous battle, the peryton and possessed birds were killed. Wanting to retrieve the egg from the bag, Kaihakan was bit by the baby peryton, who had hatched during the fight. The question of what to do with the creature was raised. Sable ([[Sable Martes]]) offered to buy it to sell it to a menagerie in the Siblíns. Master Powell insisted that the potentially dangerous beast be put down. [[Liv]] thought the infant did not deserve to die or be imprisoned.
### Session 09
[[Gurt]], [[Kaihakan]] and Brenlinn ([[Yazim]]) set sail in search of the source of the attacking birds. Guided by the clue [[Telmay]] had overheard, they travelled east until arriving at the floating body of a dead whale surrounded by seaweed. As they got in dinghy to get closer, they realized it was enchanted as a floating base. Upon entering, they were greeted by a grotesque sea hag ([[Petrelle]]), who had captured a gnome woman, [[Rena]], in a cage. After the party ([[Adventurers]]) refused her offer of gifts, and she would not agree to leave the village alone, Gurt cut the ropes around Rena's wrists and a battle ensued. The aura of fear this hag radiated dropped Kaihakan and Brenlin into unconsciousness instantly, but Gurt and Rena bravely fought off the hag and her chimera-like bird/fish creatures. Rena dealt the killing blow with her shadow blade on the sea hag, and Gurt closed her magical clam, freeing the birds. In examining the items left in the whale, some magic items were discovered, along with a bottle containing a note from [[Orguk]], the previous Orc captain to the crew.

The group headed back to the village, and impressed by Rena's fighting skills, hired her on as a new member. Once back at the village, the party spoke to [[Liv]] who had been caring for the baby peryton. The party agreed that so long as Liv was willing to watch over it, and not let it harm any members of the crew, the party would escort the peryton back to its natural habitat in the [[Jagged Isle]]. The party planned to sell shroomwood for a profit in the Jagged Isle, and purchase green salt to trade back. The crew, especially Geera, expressed a desire to find Orguk. Kaihakan called a group meeting and explained while we were not going to sail in that direction yet, with some patience he would talk to Brenlinn and convince him to head to search for Orguk on the way back. 

On their way to the Jagged Isle, the group narrowly escaped a vortex that threatened to swallow the ship. They also passed by a _totally-not-cannibals_ island called [[Traveller's Rest]]. The party wasn't tired though so they decided not to land... 

Upon arrival at the Jagged Isle, the party, which had all applied a disguise of some sort, were met by the harbourmaster. With some clever storytelling, Kaihakan convinced him that the party were members of the [[Green Salt Trading Company]] and had just happened to lose their papers in an unfortunate series of events. The harbourmaster allowed the ship to dock and told the party to head down to the main trading house, where they could get as much green salt they could purchase.
## Act 4 - Mountains of Salt
The party travels to the Jagged Isle to release a young peryton. They meets Goliaths and learn more about Green Salt and the people who mine it.

### Session 10
The adventurers spent the first few hours in [[Sealtham]] trying to make deals. It was a very industrial and drab city where the only decorations were posters inviting workers to emulate the productivity of Alex, a Goliath miner. While trying to find a buyer for their shroomwood, the party met a merchant who was quite insistent to learn the provenance of the high-quality material. Thinking humour might help, Brenlinn showed him his laughing dried fish head, a magical trinket he got from the hag’s lair. The man immediately called guards and an altercation ensued. Noticing the argument, Zak, a young white-haired half-elf approached and was able to diffuse the situation as he knew the guards. Up until recently, he had been working in the main mine outside of town, as a sentence for piracy. Taking an interest in the adventurers who seemed to be hiding magic abilities just like him, he offered his services to the team, boasting of his experience in the area. The adventurers were able to sell their shroomwood to a young fisherwoman who wanted to build her own boat. 

That night, they were ready to leave for the peryton territory marked on the hag's map. Rena took charge of the cage, flying above town in the magical rowboat obtained from the hag’s lair. Zak had shrouded it in a cloud of fog in order to hide it. Rena had a near collision with a flying flock of geese but made it through. The rest of the group walked up the path into the mountains. They passed the entrance of the main mine, where they convinced the guards that they were simple travellers.

The party reunited further up the trail and started the hike up the mountain. It was a multi-day tiring journey, especially since they couldn't always find shelter from torrential showers. In a hurry to reach their destination before the peryton reached maturity and his full killing power, the decided against investigating a large crack in the rock. The monster had been rapidly growing in his cage and his eating habits had evolved. He soon rejected the ground up meat rations Godfrey had been feeding him. The group went hunting after a mountain goat they noticed in the distance. They had to pass a rickety rope bridge that swayed and threatened to crack. Once the goat was dead, a pack of hungry wolves approached, attracted by the kill. The adventurers had to fight the wolves but were able to feed the peryton fresh meat.
### Session 11
The group ([[Adventurers]]) kept heading towards their marked destination in hopes of releasing the peryton. He was now too large to fit comfortably in his cage so, at [[Liv]]’s insistence, he was allowed to travel alongside the party members while they kept a close eye on him. Thankfully, he was still bonded to Godfrey and didn’t seem to be trying to attack anyone on the journey.

After a long day’s travel, the party stopped to spend the night in a sheltered area. They decided to watch over each other and the peryton in shifts of two hours intervals. Brennlin took the first watch with no issues. During the second watch, [[Zak]] found himself distracted and didn’t notice the presence of a group of Goliaths watching the party, until one had snuck up behind him and pressed a blade to his throat. Zak tried to explain himself, but it seemed that the warriors didn’t understand any Common. Luckily, he could speak Primordial which they could somewhat understand as they spoke a derived language, Giant. Zak managed to argue the adventurers were “good strangers” and not the “bad strangers” that the Goliaths were cautious of, so they allowed him to wake up his companions. The chief explained they had ended up camping near a [[Goliath tribe]] hiding from Steorrians authorities. When the Jagged Isle was colonised by the Kingdom of Steorr ([[Steorr]]), most Goliaths were driven out of their ancestral territory to facilitate green salt mining operations in the mountains. Some Goliaths ended up working in the mines, not always by choice. Brennlin remembered the posters of the Goliath miner in town, with the caption inspiring others to “work hard like Alex!”. Zak related to the Goliaths with his own similar experience spending a year forced by Steorr to mine green salt as punishment for his history of piracy. Zak and the Goliaths shared their common hatred for these “bad strangers” and Zak taught the Goliaths that in Common, these people were called “dicks”.

Zak explained that the group was travelling on a mission to release a “pet”, which a female Goliath thought to be [[Rena]] due to her small size. When the sleeping peryton was revealed to the Goliath, they jumped back in shock at the sight of him. They viewed the “butcherbirds” as a good natural defence to keep strangers at bay in the wild, but thought the group was crazy for keeping one as a pet, however tame it seemed. The chief confirmed the party was headed in the right direction for releasing him.

Trying to relate with potential magic users, Zak showed off some of his skills, casting a flog cloud from his hands for a few seconds. The chief was impressed by this display of “weather power” and promised Zak he could meet the village shaman in the morning.

Satisfied that the adventurers were not of any danger to his tribe, the chief offered to take them to the Goliath settlement for the evening and let them rest there on the condition that the peryton waited outside. They had expanded and maintained a network of caves in the side of the mountain where their small community lived in relative peace.

In the morning, the party made its way over to the shaman with the village chief. The shaman, an older Goliath woman, welcomed them into her cavern room and asked what “powers” they could demonstrate. Zak again showed off his fog cloud, while Rena created marvellous illusions that pleased the chief. He brought in a group of children to see the magic for themselves. Enamoured with Rena’s magic, the Goliath children all crowded around her in amazement. To help add to Rena’s show, Brennlin cast Faerie Fire on top of everyone, raining glitter on them all. Before leaving, [[Gurt]] created a small wooden duck for the kids to play with and imbued it with the power to quack. The kids all fought over the toy, before the chief intervened and instructed his son to share. The shaman asked Zak to create a fog cloud over a nearby river and in return she blessed the party with an aura of stealth to avoid danger (Pass Without Trace). Before they left the camp, the chief pointed them which direction to go and told them they would pass the cabin of a nearby hunter, who was also a “good stranger”.

During the journey, the party started worrying that the peryton would not be able to fend for himself in the wild. Gurt had the bright idea to have Godfrey teach the peryton to hunt from a pack of goats that the party spotted nearby. Thanks to the shaman’s blessing, both of them were able to make their ambush with no issue, with the peryton following Godfrey’s lead. He was able to feed himself a delicious serving of freshly plucked goat heart, and the party continued on with the now satiated peryton, not having to worry if they would be his next meal for a while.

The party found a hidden narrow path just off the main track that the Goliaths told them of. Deciding to lead the way, Brennlin took about ten steps forward before firmly placing his foot onto an unseen beartrap. After struggling to remove it, he was eventually able to free himself thanks to the help of Zak and Gurt. After damaging both his foot and his ego, Brennlin decided against going first, and Gurt let Godfrey take the lead. Godfrey found two more traps before the party spotted the hunter’s cabin, but also his body. The old man had his ribcage torn open and his heart ripped out, most likely by an adult peryton. The sight interested the young peryton, but thankfully he was still full from his goat brunch. Zak offered the now-deceased hunter’s bow to Liv so she had a weapon to take care of herself. Brennlin stashed the supply of dried meats that hanged in the cabin. Noticing the meat had been cured with green salt, he investigated the house to find a amount out of which Gurt made a Minor Healing Potion.

After a while of struggling to dig the man a grave in the coarse, mountainous dirt, the party eventually managed to bury the man in the woods near his home - not too far off where he was killed. Liv found herself disturbed after seeing such a bloodied corpse. She asked if the members of the party followed any god and wanted to say a prayer. No one stepped forward, so she uttered a few words and hoped the hunter was in a better place.

The location marked on the map only a day away, the party decided they would be safe to just release the peryton there, as the monsters’ presence was obvious from the hunter’s violent death. During another hunting session, Gurt had Godfrey attempt to sneak away from the peryton’s side, but the peryton grew frantic noticing Godfrey had left his side and ran after him. Gurt then had Godfrey feint an attack at the peryton, pecking at him angrily. The peryton tried cuddling up to Godfrey and purring, only to find himself attacked by Godfrey again. The startled peryton flapped his wings in defence. Zak magically manifested a peryton cry in the distance, which drew the young monsters attention. As Godfrey went for a third peck, the peryton flew off.

The party then travelled back the way they came with no issues or disruptions, subsisting off the hunter’s collection of cured meats. They stopped in to visit the Goliath camp and inform them of the passing of the hunter, and of the successful release of the young peryton.

On their way back to Sealtham, the party decided to investigate the cave they passed by a few days before. The large crack in the side of the mountain lead to a dark drop about sixty feet down. Gurt picked up a pebble, imbued with light, and threw it down the crack. They could spot what seemed to be the beginning of a passageway at the bottom of the drop, and they could see spider webs lining the walls on the drop down. After inspecting the stonework, Gurt noted that while the crack was mostly a natural formation, there seemed to be evidence of it having been widened by tools.

The party tied ropes to climb down the crack. After travelling down the previously spotted corridor, they came across a strange old man named Parker. His mind halfway broken, he asked the party to search for his missing “puppy”. He told them there were two other cave rooms, the bathroom and the playroom. When asked why he didn’t investigate himself, he said he was scared of the loud noises coming from the playroom.

The party started off investigating the “bathroom” which was a mostly empty cave room with a small pool of running water, formed from water escaping from the ceiling and collecting below. At the bottom of the pool was a small opening in which the water was escaping as quickly as it was gathering. It seemed like the opening could be squeezed through, but the party decided to investigate “the playroom” first.

The party walked into the playroom quietly. Lying flat on the floor was the skeleton of a humanoid figure, with a fallen stalactite impaled through its shattered ribcage. The party also noticed a shape struggling in a giant web, with a massive spider approaching from behind a stalactite on the ceiling.

Springing into action, the party surprised the spider, with Brennlin shooting it. The loud boom of the pistol echoed through the cave and knocked a few stalactites down onto the party, dealing serious damage to Rena and Zak.

After a few attacks focused on the spider, Rena freed the trapped creature with her blade, but it turned out it was actually a sort of large mosquito abomination, and not the supposed dog the party had been searching for. Liv attempted to speak to the two animals to see if either of them might have been Parker’s “puppy”. The buzzing insect called for friends to help it, and the spider simply responded “Woof!” in an enthusiastic manner. Realising they had been targeting the wrong creature, Liv told her companions to change focus to the mosquito, which Brennlin quickly stabbed dead with a dagger next.

Ending combat, Liv apologised to the spider on the party’s behalf. They fed it a potion to heal it’s wounds. The spider told them that Parker was his friend, and he referred to himself as Puppy as that was what he was used to being called by the old man. When asked what he was doing out here, Puppy said he went looking for food and that he wasn’t aware Parker was looking for him. Zak and Rena still quite hurt, the party decided to rest for an hour, chilling in the playroom with Puppy. During this break, they noticed at the end of the room was a small crawlspace in which crackling sounds could be heard. Deciding to investigate, they ventured in the tunnel. Rena had no issue ducking through due to her small stature, whilst everyone else had to crawl and avoid sharp crystals. Zak and Kaihakan made it through unharmed whilst Gurt and Brennlin managed to rack up a few scrapes as they went.

As the crawlspace opened up, the party found themselves in a small cave with green crystals adorning the walls, as well as two crushed humanoid skeletons equipped with mining helmets and pickaxes. Zak recognised most of the crystals as the beginning stages of green salt from his time mining, and noted that they would need at least a few weeks, if not months, before they were ready to harvest. At the end of the room was a large deposit of mature and shiny green salt. Crackling to life, it detached itself from the wall, taking the shape of a large bipedal figure, looking ready to fight.
### Session 12
The adventurers found themselves faced with a formidable opponent: a green salt giant. A tough fight ensued, with the towering monster using his powerful fists and throwing sharp shards off its body towards distant opponents. As the battle raged on, Rena's stone she kept hidden under her clothes began to vibrate, resonating with the elemental magic possessed by the giant. Eventually, the party managed to defeat the colossal creature. It exploded, causing the chamber to start collapsing. The adventurers grabbed a substantial amount of green salt and escaped through the crumbling exit tunnel. 

They said their goodbyes to Parker, who gave them his old shoes, as thanks for eliminating the source of noise in the back of his cave. In return, Brenlinn gave him his magical laughing fish head. Later, upon inspecting the footwear, Gurt realised it would allow the wearer climb surfaces like a spider. He also discovered the name "Parker Peter" inscribed on a small label inside. 

On their way back toward town, they passed the mine once again. There, they met Alex, the Goliath miner depicted on the propaganda posters in town. He was injured and alone, the guards having gone into the mine to help clear the cave-in that wounded him. He refused to consume the green salt, claiming that guards could detect it with their pendulums. The party healed Alex and asked him a few questions about his background. They gathered that he probably had been captured as a child, based on their talks with with the mountain tribe. Surprisingly, Alex seemed content with his life in the mine. In case he ever became curious enough to go meet his kin, Gurt gave him a singing carved bird just like the one he had given the tribe. 

Back in Sealtham, Rena stumbled upon Bob, who was indulging in some dreamleaf he had acquired from a stranger. In exchange for the intoxicating substance, Bob said he had pointed to the location of Otarky on a map. The party gathered the mysterious man was probably the merchant who had asked about the provenance of the shroomwood. Meanwhile, Brenlinn attempted to sell the ring he stole off Sable to Lord Mayor Brummbär. The dwarf was the local authority and a person of influence within the [[Green Salt Trading Company]]. As the the only person of means around, he was the most likely customer for the ring. However, Brenlinn's efforts were repeatedly dismissed by the busy man
Curiosity led Kai to conjure magic and make himself invisible in order to eavesdrop on Brummbär, who was engaged in a discussion with a dishevelled half-elf. The name of Orguk, the previous captain of the party, came up in conversation as well as mentions of stolen cargo and pirates. 

Thanks to Muni backing Kaihakan's earlier lies, the party obtained the paperwork that made them appear as legitimate members of the Green Salt Trading Company. However, this meant that they were now subjects to the requisition order issued by Lord Mayor Brummbär.  Along with two other ships, The Asteroidea was to be sent on a mission to hunt pirates in the Scattered Isles. The pirates had been attacking Sterorrian ships and Brummbär claimed the Crown wouldn't come to the the aid of the Green Salt Trading Company and the people of Sealtham. An elegant elven man named Mr. Fleming was assigned to oversee the operations aboard the Asteroidea, due to his knowledge of the Scattered Isles and his ties to the Company. The party finally recognised the Lord Mayor's scruffy guest as Hugh Bowes, who apparently managed to escape the island they abandoned him on. Thankfully, they were disguised and he did not seem to recognise them. 

Seeing no other option, the crew departed on their new assignment. Zak remained in Sealtham in search of other opportunities. Kai set about constructing a shrine room beneath the ship's hull. On the way to the objective, the ship briefly stopped an island named Mission. The abbot of the Unwavering Star ([[Church of the Unwavering Star]]) monastery granted an audience to the adventurers and asked them for a large donation, which they refused.

After weeks of sailing, approaching the supposed location of the pirate hideout, the three ships separated to cover a larger search area. One night, the crew of the Asteroidea heard a haunting song resonating through the air. Amidst the darkness, the silhouette of a menacing pirate ship emerged. The party braced themselves, their hearts pounding with anticipation as they prepared for an imminent confrontation.
## Act 5 - Pirates!
The party battles musical pirates and debates joining their Republic. They attend a chaotic wake on New Destiny.

- Session 14 ([[Session 14]])
- Session 15 ([[Session 15]])
### Session 13
As the eerie song echoed across the waters, no distinct source for the voice could be perceived. A pale figure of a banshee floated on the surface of the sea, menacingly approaching the party's ship. Mr. Fleming unexpectedly advised the Asteroidea's crew to surrender to the pirates before retreating below deck. Cannon fire erupted as both ships demonstrated clever manoeuvring. The pirate ship was heavily damaged, but managed to get close enough to allow its crew to board the adventurer's vessel.

The adventurers found themselves engaged in a fierce and chaotic battle with the pirates. They faced off against bare-chested  twins who fought unarmed with unmatched agility and strength. Godfrey, delivered a decisive blow, killing one of them. A elven lady clad in tight black leather wielded a whip with dangerous precision, ensnaring opponents and pulling them closer. A woman wrapped in a large cloak, displayed surprising resistance to weapon blows despite her lack of obvious armour. To his surprise, when Kai attempted to submerge her underwater, she defied expectations and did not drown. From a small rowboat, two other pirates climbed aboard the ship. One of them was a red dragonborn armed with powerful guns. The other was a human with a powerful voice infused with magic and a distinct lack of teeth. The party surmised he was the captain and the main singer of the intimidating song and. The banshee vanished when he was hit, revealing it as one of his illusions. 

Just as victory seemed within the adventurers' grasp, a sudden explosion erupted beneath the deck, sending shockwaves through the ship. In a fit of fury, Gurt hurled a cannonball assisted with magic at the already heavily damaged pirate ship, dealing a devastating blow and causing it to start sinking further. 
Amidst the chaos, Mr. Flemming emerged from below deck, with a face covered in soot and a noticeably different accent, raising suspicions about his true identity and intentions. 

As the battle raged on, the elf clad in leather was wounded and ran below deck. Later, she inexplicably returned in significantly better health and engaged in a duel with Brenlinn. She suddenly recognized him and addressed him as Yazim, revealing a past connection from their time at Bard College. The elf introduced herself as Angela, now going by the  nickname Flogging Molly due to her skills with the whip. She proceeded to introduce the main members of her crew going as [[The Bards]]: Captain Wayne MacGoshan, [[Tin Lizzie]] the undrownable mechanical woman, the twins [[Liam Murphy]] and [[Noel Murphy]] (now dead) known as the Dropkick Murphys, [[Red Rum Jack]] the dragonborn. [[Vesper Martini]] shed the identity of Mr Fleming and revealed they were actually a spy for a pirate crew allied with the Bards. These introductions indicated the potential for an unexpected alliance and further revelations to come.
### Session 14
After the end of the battle, the party ([[Adventurers]]) discovered [[Brother Uriel]], a young evangelist from the [[Church of the Unwavering Star]], chained up under the deck of the pirate ship. [[The Bards]] had captured him while he was evangelizing in the [[Northern Scattered Isles]] and forced him to heal them with his divine power. The adventurers refused to exploit his magic but also didn't argue in his favour. The pirates swore they would ransom him back to [[Mission]]. The party also deliberated on the fate of the Steorrian soldiers ([[Steorrian army]]) that had been sent on the expedition with them, ultimately deciding to ransom them back to [[Steorr]].

Using codewords, [[Vesper Martini]] said they were working for the 'M' of the 'MI6', which the Bards explained was referring to [[Captain Morgan]] of the [[The Drunks]]. The pirates were involved in estbalishing a Republic ([[Republic]]) based on the island of [[New Destiny]], forging a path of freedom independant from the main powers of the the Islands. They were in the process of developping a Code ([[Pirate Code]]) to govern the new country. One important of this Code was crews chosing their captains that would form a council to make decisions for the Republic. Two of these captains were Wayne ([[Wayne MacGoshan]]) and Morgan ([[Captain Morgan]]).

The most recent addition to the council turned out to be [[Orguk]], who captained the party's ship until it was attacked by a sea monster. He had provided the pirates with valuable information: Steorrian ships in the region, especilly linked with the Green Salt Trading Company, had been secretely transporting magic items. This proved to be a precious bounty for the Repuplic and was the reason behind the recent attacks. Orguk was sometimes ridiculed within the Republic for his lack of ship and crew.

The party also learned that [[Calico Jack]], another captain of the Republic, was currently a captive on Cavea, a Siblín prison island situated between [[Áine]] and Ben. [[Yazim]] knew that Esmith, his childhood friend and former smuggling partner, was also held there.

Wayne and Molly attempted to persuade the adventurers to become part of the Republic. Wayne employed his magical abilities to influence their decision but they refused. However, they saw that their interests could align. The Bards offered to carry out repairs on New Destiny and the party agreed to tow the pirates' ship there. The party therefore set sail towards the Republic, their mind brimming with a mix of caution and excitement.
### Session 15
After arriving to [[New Destiny]], the party ([[Adventurers]]) visited shops ([[Shops of the Republic v1]]) and acquired several items. Kai ([[Kaihakan]]) bought an enchanted shield and [[Rena]] a red stone, similar to her own green one. [[Yazim]] managed to sell some Green Salt healing potions to the apothecary miscellaneous for a good price.

In the evening, the party attended [[Noel Murphy]]'s Wake, where Wayne ([[Wayne MacGoshan]]) delivered a heartfelt eulogy. Music, drinking and games created a festive atmosphere. However, tensions arose when Liam ([[Liam Murphy]]) attacked Godfrey for killing his brother. [[Tin Lizzie]] stepped in to protect Godfrey. Drunk bystanders were caught in the crossfire, resulting in a full-scale choatic bar brawl with a fire erupting and objects being thrown. Wayne interrupted the fight before anyone was too badly hurt and the festivities resume.

The next morning, the adventurers visited the Auction House, where the goblin [[Xander]] identified Sable's ring as a scrying device. Yazim realised he may have been spied on every time the ring was outside bag of holding. Among the items on auction, Rena recognized an alchemy jug that her previous crew had stolen from [[Northern Scattered Isles]] natives in the past but kept silent. During the auction, the adventurers aquired a pair of magical conches that allowed for remote communication and sold off the eggs they got from the hag.

At the shipyard, the party made arrangements at the shipyard to repair their vessel, ensuring it was ready for upcoming challenges. They also planned for major cosmetic changes, to make it unrecognisable. They changed the figurehead and renamed it The Star and Dove. [[Muni]] asked for a raise for [[Crew]] which the adventurers granted. They said their goodbyes to Liv would take the next ship heading towards Otarky.

Kaihakan walked the long suspended bridge leading to the Priestless Temple, located on a rock battered by the waves. There, he found an interesting collection of idols and carvings, dedicated to the worship of many gods. In front of an old carving of a squid reminiscent of his own Tanawhu, he found [[Orguk]] praying. The orc recounted his journey, how he grabbed onto a tentacle when the ship was sinking and how he eventually found his way to Eleuthera where he encountered Wayne's crew. A changed man, he now worshipped the Squid, viewing it as a symbol of endurance in the face of adversity. He was interested in learning more about Tanawhu from Kaihakan.

[[Gurt]] and Rena conducted experiments with the mysterious red stone. They discovered it responded strongly to elemental magic.

From the Molly and Wayne, Yazim learned of the various missions presented by the Republic: capturing an armored ship for defense, finding Elizabeth Grey to have her join the Republic, raiding Steorrian ships for magic items, freeing Calico Jack, exchanging prisoners for ransom. Orguk was also interested tracking down the shipwreck of the Arrow as magic items were probably still there. The party decided to follow this lead, figuring that the treasure would make the orc less likely to try and steal their ship and crew.
## Act 6 - What we Treasure
Returning to the wrecked ship with Orguk, the party salvages magic items. Refusing to either invite Grey to the Republic or go hunt her, they tarnish her reputation in New Destiny.

- Session 16 ([[Session 16]])
- Session 17 ([[Session 17]])
### Session 16
The party ([[Adventurers]]) learned that the Arrow had been spotted still floating despite the sea monster attack. [[Orguk]] hoped to retake the ship for himself if it was still in sailing condition. He therefore hired a crew of five, opening a line of credit with the party to afford wages. Even if it was impossible to claim the ship, Orguk knew it probably still held treasures in its hold. The orc agreed that any loot above the value of a sloop (7000 gp) would go to the adventurers and their crew.

The party managed to sail to the Arrow and noticed it was severely damaged but seemingly held together by seaweed and barnacles. [[Rena]] remained on the Star and Dove to study, while the rest of the party went to board the Arrow with Orguk. The party explored the ship and soon found themselves in a fierce battle with the monstrous crustacean creatures that inhabited the ship, hiding amongst rubble and seaweed. During their exploration, they discovered a locked crate chained up in hold. Detaching it from the wall was easy enough but they could not best the lock on the crate itself.

As they were about to retreat to the Star and Dove, the ship was suddenly ensnared by massive tentacles, trapping them in a perilous situation. [[Yazim]], used his magic to reduce the size of the crate, allowing it to fit on the flying rowboat with Orguk, who was able to navigate the rumbling ship to escape. The adventurers made their way back onto the deck, dodging tentacles, crumbling planks, and fleeing crustaceans. On their way out, a strange man with a high-pitch voice holding a staff topped with a crab pincer screamed at them to leave his ship alone. They ignored him, continuing their escape. Gurt using his magical technology, swam away at high speed, followed by Yazim.

Before leaving, Kai ([[Kaihakan]]) swam underwater to get a look at the giant octopus responsible the chaos. To his surprise, the creature reached out and touched Kai's forehead with a tentacle, conveying a message: "When the time comes, you will come free me." Kai rejoined his companions before the monster had a chance to change its mind and attack him instead of the Arrow, which was now colllapsing into the sea.
### Session 17
While the crate was in its reduced state, the party managed to break it open and discovered a vast amounts of magic items inside. With these treasures, [[Orguk]] would have enough to buy a ship, and the party made a substantial profit of roughly 5000 gp. Each member of the party kept a magic item and a trinket of their choice, while the remaining items were prepared for sale at the auction house. The crate also contained an entry document to the Siblíns prepared by [[Hugh Bowes]].

As they were managing the loot, the adventurers heard some commotion on the deck. The man they had met on the floating wreck of the Arrow had made his way to the ship and was attacking members of the crew. With a gaping mouth and unmoving lips, he screamed in a high-pitch voice that they had destroyed his ship so he would take theirs. With deadly efficiency, the adventurers killed him before he could land a single attack. Examining his body, they noticed he was missing his tongue and found a mysterious note.

The Star and Dove made its way back to [[Republic]], where [[Gurt]] and [[Yazim]] sought out [[Inkbeard]] to acquire magical tattoes. [[Kaihakan]] followed as he was interested in the process. However, he was kicked out after critizing the tackiness of the designs. With the aid of invisibility, he snuck back in to observe. However, [[Inkbeard]] heard him and angrily refused to finish Yazim's tatttoo before Kai left and and extra charge was paid.

In New Destiny, the talk of the town was split about inviting [[Elisabeth Grey]] to join the Republic. [[Captain Morgan]] and his followers saw her as a potentially powerful pirate ally while [[The Bards]] and others feared she might corrupt the young Republic, due to her indiscriminate attacks on civilians of the Northern Scattered Isles. The party also thought she would be a bad influence, but differed on what approach to take. Wayne ([[Wayne MacGoshan]]) wanted to seek her out and kill her, while Gurt preferred to avoid direct confrontation. The party decided to tarnish Grey's reputation in the Republic, spreading rumours about her, starting with the watering hole frequented by [[The Sea Dogs]].

The party decided to set sail towards the Siblín Guilds, planning a prison break. They hoped to free Calico Jack for the Republic, and Esmith for Yazim. They would use information provided by Vesper about the prison island of Cavea. After facing a storm, they made it to the Áine harbour. However, they lacked a vouching contact required to gain entry to the Siblíns. Through officials, they sent a message to [[Sable Martes]] along with her ring, hoping she would vouch for them. As a backup plan, Gurt also carved a lifelike falcon figurine to apply to join the Woodcarvers Guild.
## Act 7 - Uncorking the Vintage
The party travels to the Siblín Islands, executing a dramatic prison break and unearthing an explosive plot.

- [[Session 18]]
- [[Session 19]]
- [[Session 20]]
- [[Session 21]]
- [[Session 22]]
### Session 18
While the Star and Dove was waiting for its authorisation to enter Siblíns territory, [[Sable Martes]] made her way to the ship. Through her Ring of Scrying, she had been spying the party and knew their activities weren't always above board. After a shrewd business discussion, they brokered a deal to sell their healing potions through her. 

The party then started planning how they would break [[Calico Jack]] and [[Esmith Wesson]] out of [[Cavea]], based on information obtained from [[Vesper Martini]]. Back for a second visit, Sable revealed that she had planted her ring in the captain's quarter before leaving and eavesdropped on their plan. She offered to help the adventurers infiltrate the prison as cooks or maintenance staff in exchange for a better deal on healing potions and they accepted.

With Sable vouching for them, the adventurers were allowed to enter [[Áine]] and the [[Siblín Guilds]] at large. Disguised as new recruits for the kitchen, they made their way to Cavea, where they faced anti-magic measures and strict security. [[Gurt]] disassembled Godfrey as pets weren't allowed in the prison and waited until he could rebuild him while hiding in the kitchen backroom. [[Rena]] summoned a rat familiar named Merlin and used him to locate Jack and Esmith's cells and sent them a message to prepare for the escape. 

The next evening, the party started a fire in the kitchen and use every mean necessary to make it spread and cause chaos. Adding to the confusion, Gurt had Godfrey run around to distract the guards. The fire grew so much that alarms started blaring and the guards had to evacuate most prisoners to the yard. The party blended in with the crowd and summoned a roc, with the magic token from the sea hag. The gargantuan bird grabbed the party and the two convicts in its claws and took off.

However, the warden rushed out and used a powerful wand to immobilize the roc. Her attempt was thwarted by Rena who managed to counter the spell with her own magic, allowing everyone to fly away. The party instructed the roc to drop them off at a safe location and then fly away in the opposite direction. Back in Áine, [[Yazim]] tracked down [[Lou Beluga]], an old friend from his smuggling days, and asked him to hide Jack and Esmith.
### Session 19
After their daring prison break, the adventurers noticed that guards were on high alert, carrying frequent stops and occasional searches. They decided to stay a week in Áine to follow the terms of their authorisation and avoid raising suspicion. Lou Beluga was hiding Calico Jack and Esmith in a secret cellar under his inn, the White Straw Hat. Using the inn as a base, the adventurers went to explore the city on their own. 

##### Kaihakan
Seeking to practice the art of tattooing, Kaihakan approached Baha, a heavily tattooed whaler captain as she was supervising the unloading of her crew's latest catch. She invited him to join her crew's celebration at The Net Profits tavern. There, she regaled him with whaling stories and offered some whale meat, which he politely refused. Still, she guided him in tattooing a scene on the back of her neck. However, Baha and her crew abruptly fell ill, wrongly accusing Kaihakan of poisoning their meal.

Chaos erupted as the poisoned sailors attacked Kaihakan. He fled through the streets as they chased him and called for guards, but a cloaked sea elf woman grabbed him into an alley. She pressed a blade to his throat, but rather than harm Kaihakan, she ushered him into the sewers to escape. 

Kaihakan realised he had seen the elf earlier, watching the whaling ship from the rooftops. She led Kaihakan through winding underground tunnels to a flooded cave that served as her hideout and introduced herself as Aumiha. She confronted him, questioning his association with whalers. She saw whales as envoys of Savisi'lo, preservers of the peace of the sea and the underworld beyond. Kaihakan defended his faith an culture, that saw Savisi'lo as a tyrannical ruler, Tanawhu as an empowering god and whales as the only reliable food source in the Hakari Isles. 

After a tense conversation, Aumiha explained that she had been sent by her tribe to investigate the whales' migration away from the south of the archipelago. She had witnessed the intensity of whaling by Siblín sailors, and had learned how ambergris from their bellies was used to make perfumes for the rich. Ambergris was the "mana" the Hakari used in their rituals, so this practice seemed sacrilegious to Kaihakan as well. Aumiha revealed she had poisoned the whale meat with a purplish substance she had found leaking from the ceiling of a nearby cave. Their goals temporarily aligned, she asked Kaihakan to help her do the same with ambergris to send a message from the sea elves. 

Kaihakan agreed and used his powers to turn invisible and infiltrate the harbour warehouse indicated by Aumiha. He tricked guards with his summoned tentacle and found the crate of ambergris. Keeping a portion for himself, he tainted the rest of the supply. He reported back to Aumiha, who thanked him and provided him with a crude map to the location of her hideout. This way, should Kaihakan end up in trouble with the authorities, he could put the blame on her. She announced that she would be going back to her tribe and they bid each other farewell.

##### Rena
Rena ventured into Áine's famed Eólas Library in search of knowledge. Amidst aisles filled with countless tomes and scrolls, mechanical servants made of metal and wood were carrying out sorting operations. 

Sat in a quiet spot, Rena studied cartography, honing her navigation expertise. Her research also informed her about Siblín society, diverse yet regimented into specialized guilds. In between paragraphs, she kept an eye on the entrance of the "Magic" and "Experimental" restricted sections, where guards were checking visitors' credentials. She noticed automatons carting damaged texts and parts down towards an area marked "Disposal".

After summoning her familiar Merlin in the shape of a spider, she sent him to investigate the restricted sections. He gathered little information before vanishing, first in the magic section after being squashed by a guard, then out of range in the disposal area. 

Taking matters into her own hands, Rena magically morphed into a copy of the librarian automaton. In disguise, she made her way past the guards and down to Disposal. Among the piles of discarded items, she salvaged a old spell book and a damaged scroll. In a deeper cave-like area, she noticed crumbled sections of walls that seem to lead to other underground tunnels but could not get past them. 

Perhaps more intriguingly, she encountered a confused automaton head with shiny blue eyes that addressed her as "User" and offered to answer her queries. Suspicious and running out of time before the library closing time, she kept the interaction brief. She hurried back to the surface and exited Eólas after returning to her usual appearance. 

##### Yazim
Yazim had a tough conversation with Esmith, during which she blamed him for abandoning his crew, his family, and her. She told Yazim that the girls of their crew were all executed while she was sent to prison. Yazim apologised, explaining he thought his family would be safer if he left and that he needed time to figure out his best plan of action. 

Reluctantly opening up, Esmith revealed that she had eavesdropped on her parents while she was held in jail before being transferred to Cavea. She heard Erin and Pierce Wesson say they couldn’t risk Esmith bringing any attention to “their plans” and that it would be safer for them to have her imprisoned. She understood her status probably saved her life but her parents decision doomed her to Cavea.

Thinking some of her old contacts could help gather information about her family's secret dealings, she ask Yazim to reach out to Knapper Gall, the elderly gnome that worked for her parents as a cleaner. She knew he used to drink at the Cove Inn in the evening after his shift.

Visiting the location of his family's old bakery and house, he found that it had been turned into a shoe and hat shop. Chatting with the shopkeeper Millie while trying shoes on, he learned that the previous occupiers had left about a year ago and that the current landlady was named Mrs Nocent.

Later in the evening, Yazim went to the Cove Inn to meet with Knapper. In case backup was needed, he brought Lou along but remained evasive about the purpose of the outing. After meeting Knapper, it took Yazim repeated attempts and a bit of magic to get past the nervous, distrustful gnome's defences. Eventually Knapper agreed to help, out of affection for Esmith. He gave Yazim a key that would unlock and disarm magic alarms of Erin's city office, telling him to look for the ledger where Esmith mother kept records of business activities. Knapper pleaded for discretion, urging Yazim to leave no trace of his presence and not remove anything. He told Yazim the key had to be back within two hours when he would leave, so his routine would remain identical to avoid arousing suspicion.

Yazim made his way to the office and spent some time looking for the ledger in the dark, to no avail. After covering the window with thick clothes he had found in a chest, he was able to use a candle without any light being visible from the outside. The candlelight allowed him to find a hidden compartment in Erin's desk. Inside, he found the ledger and started leafing through it. Realising that whine stains on the paper that did not appear random but in fact marking specific entries, he copied the relevant sections of the ledger, before putting the room back in order. Short on time, he ran back to the Cove Inn, where he was able to hand the key to Knapper discreetly.

##### Gurt 
Gurt explored Áine on his own, seeking to join a craft guild for additional income. After struggling to locate the Clockwork Guild House, ultimately connected with the small Woodcarvers Guild with which he left an enchanted carved eagle as an application.

Master Carver Madera interviewed Gurt, intrigued by his magical craftwork. Though impressed, she explained that joining a guild in the Siblíns was a commitment akin to becoming a citizen. She also implied that authorities had interest in bird constructs related to a recent crime and said her guild would offer protection, but Gurt feigned ignorance. She cautioned him about aligning with certain groups who would be interested in his abilities.

A few days before the party was to leave Áine, Gurt received a mysterious invitation to meet at the Túram clock tower, joining an exclusive tour led by the half-elf Seraphina. While one of the visitors, a young foreign elf named Tolmiri, was chatting to him, he began experiencing piercing headaches from an unknown source. Creating a smoke effect in response, he caused an evacuation and was intercepted by one of the mechanics from the Clockwork Guild, the kobold Nixt. This was his secret contact. Gurt guardedly followed Nixt to a hidden room of the Undercity. There, the kobold asked him to disassemble a magic pair of boots. Nixt used a device to extract the magic energy from the boots, and condensed into a strange purple liquid, before demonstrating its explosive potential. He promised the artificer vast funds and arcane revelations, trying to secure his membership. Though intrigued, Gurt asked for time before committing and convinced Nixt to give him until the next day.
### Session 20
Lou Beluga had invited Hildy, a skilled musician originally from Steorr to play at the inn that night. Her beautiful melodies created a festive atmosphere, allowing the group to catch up and share recent discoveries. Piecing together clues, they gathered that the Wessons family was involved in a plot to manufacture destructive weapons from magic items. They decided to investigate the Sunrise winery, navigating through the Undercity to approach stealthily. 

They entered the underground tunnels using the sewer grate that Aumiha had showed Kaihakan. Navigating the perilous passages, the group overheard two strangers arguing about  bringing a woman underground to rob her. One of them seemed reluctant. Gurt recognized the intended victim as Tolmiri, who he had met earlier in the day. The party ambushed the would-be attackers, knocking the more menacing one unconscious. They convinced his companion to stand down. He introduced himself as Fancy and his friend as Fitch. He brought the adventurers to their Haven, where they met the Guildless, an underground community made up of marginalised people who, due to disabilities, criminal records, or other reasons, are excluded from the Siblín guild system. There, they found a young halfling woman named Yonder who agreed to lead them through the Undercity.

Following Yonder's guidance, they moved through the winding tunnels. When traversing catacombs, she warned them to carefully avoid disturbing old bones and awakening their spirits. They distracted a disoriented patrol, leading the guards away with an illusion. After neutralizing the squad leader, they were closer than ever from the winery's cellar.
### Session 21
The party, guided by Yonder, entered a large metal pipe. Walking north, they encountered a metal grate with bars too narrow for most of them to pass through. Gurt, Kai, and Yazim climbed into the Bag of Holding, allowing Rena to carry them through, while she and Yonder squeezed through the bars, being of smaller stature. Suddenly, there was a low rumble ahead and Yonder started running back, warning the party of oncoming rushing water. The entire party was caught in the strong current, pushed backward and battered by debris.

Kai swam back to aid Yonder, while Gurt and Yazim used their Cloak of the Manta Ray and Mariner's Armor to swim against the current. Yazim grabbed onto Godfrey, who anchored them to the rivets in the pipe with his beak. Kai crashed into the grate, shielding Yonder with his body before helping her pass through the bars. He then re-joined Gurt and the two progressed forward together, with Gurt stabbing his dagger into the side of the pipe for support. As the flow of water subsided, the party was shaken and drenched but relatively unscathed. 

They returned to Yonder, who had broken her leg. They healed her and she started opening up to the party. The halfling offered to introduce Kaihakan to Moku, an elderly elf with similar tattoos who also lived in the Undercity. She also urged the party to hire her and her sister Hither in the future. Satisfied they could reach their goal from there, the party bid goodbye to their guide. 

The party continued through the pipe, arriving at the bottom of a large cistern. Yazim peeked inside and, detecting nothing, signalled for his companions to enter. However, the pipe closed up behind them and they were ambushed by a group of guards who were positioned on a walkway surrounding the top of the cistern. Commanding them was the Kobold Nixt who had met Gurt earlier. The dwarf attempted to justify his group's presence, but Nixt ordered the guards to eliminate the adventurers.

As the battle ensued, Nixt used an instrument panel on the wall to manipulate the water levels, hoping to drown his enemies and control the battlefield. This was underestimating the swimming gear and rare skills of the party. Yazim cast spells to make two guards to throw their crossbows and dive into the water, negating their advantage. Kaihakan and his spectral tentacle, Gurt and his mechanical goose fought valiantly, taking down guards one by one. Crocodiles emerged from a pipe and surrounded Yazim, one grabbing him in its jaws. However, he killed them all with a skilful shattering spell. All his allies having died, Nixt turned invisible and tried to escape, but Yazim revealed his presence with a spell, allowing Gurt and Godfrey to finish him off. Using a key found on Nixt's body, the party was able to operate the control panel and open the adjacent door.
### Session 22
The party made their way into a large room that appeared to be a blend of a distillery and an alchemical lab. A complex network of tubes led from busy workbenches to a large copper still atop a furnace. A few magic items seemed to await processing, while drained ones were destined for disposal. Kaihakan recognised a leak from a waste pipe as the acid the sea elf Aumiha had used. Yazim bottled some up for future use. 

This place was obviously the centre of operations for manufacturing the explosive liquid Gurt had been shown by the kobold Nixt earlier. Research documents and coded messages referred to it as the "Vintage". The party gathered as much evidence as they could, grabbing notes and equipment. 

Kai attempted to collect a sample of the dangerous liquid itself from the filling station. However, his fingers slipped and he dropped the bottle. A loud and low rumble filled the room, as magical force quickly expanded in a devastating explosion, damaging a large area of the lab.  Kaihakan was severely hurt, temporarily blinded and stunned. Also wounded, Yazim supported the impaired Kaihakan as the party rushed to leave, as guards would surely be alerted by the noise. 

As the group entered the mechanical lift, a bell attached to it rang out. Surmising this signalled someone called the lift from upstairs, they quickly developed a plan. Yazim disguised himself as the late Nixt and Rena as a guard. Upstairs, they encountered the gruff dwarven overseer Goldberg with a group of guards. Gurt and Yazim spun a tale that Kaihakan had infiltrated the lab and caused the explosion during a recruitment meeting. After tense negotiations, the party suggested they could dispose of the intruder by feeding him to crocodiles and Goldberg allowed the group to depart.

They went back to the lab below to collect more evidence. Yazim attempted to pick a locker, but to no avail. Kai, having regained his senses, smashed the locker repeatedly and was able to break it open. Inside, they found jewellery, including a signet ring bearing a large W and a small O, most likely Orla Wesson's. Fearing the noise would alert Goldberg and his crew, they decided to flee.  Moving through purple shimmering vapours from the Vintage explosion, they magically turned invisible. Taking advantage of this, they navigated back through the Undercity tunnels from whence they came.

They returned to Esmith, who confirmed that the Eason family had a dislike for her parents and might help take them down. Indeed, they had some political sway and involvement in the major newspaper, the Guilded Gazette. The party visited the press first thing in the morning and met the print master Norimor Eason, who seemed a bit senile. His sister Norimor was colder, but listened to them. After presenting evidence against the Wessons' Vintage operation, the party negotiated a deal. In exchange for her support in exposing the Wessons, Neverins demanded the party handle a crucial matter first: bringing down a pirate operation that was hiding underground in the city and threatened Eason interests.
## Act 8 - Who's Lurking There
The party investigates what secrets machinations are happening in the Undercity of Áine and aboard their own ship.

- [[Session 23]]
- [[Session 24]]
- [[Session 25]]
### Session 23
The party ventured once again into the Undercity, following the directions provided by the Easons. Their journey took them through various storage areas and unexpectedly onto the street, where they awkwardly improvised excuses to explain their presence to suspicious guards.

Upon reaching the alleged pirate hideout, they encountered a group of young individuals who fled at their approach. The chase that ensued took a dangerous turn when the fleeing group released dangerous slimes, causing chaos and tragically claiming the life of one of their own. As the situation escalated, the group realized the party's intentions were not hostile. They revealed the slimes' weakness to water. Seizing the opportunity, Kaihakan retrieved the flying dinghy from their bag of holding, using it to release a torrent of water upon the slimes. This clever tactic effectively neutralized the threat and brought the conflict to an end.

In the aftermath, the truth came to light. These supposed pirates were, in fact, Guildless youth operating a clandestine printing and manuscript copying operation to spread knowledge among their community. The party decided to spare the youth but demanded they cease their operations, at least in this location. Recognizing the limited opportunities available to the Guildless in Áine, they suggested they might find better prospects in the Republic. They recovered stolen books, as wells as tools, including a rudimentary printing press. They also found an intriguing android head under piles of parchments.

With their mission accomplished, the party returned to Neverins Eason to report their findings and surrender the goods, with the exception of the mechanical head. This meeting solidified their agreement. The Easons would help to expose the Wessons' illicit activities and grand the party Guild membership, a status that could become official in two weeks. However, the party decided to take part in the following ceremony in seven weeks instead. They wanted to leave Áine quickly but had a few matters to take care of before.
### Session 24
Talked to Sable to sell more healing potions 
She seemed bothered by the party joining forces with the Easons rather than her but she nevertheless offered to use her connections to bypass the mandatory ship inspection on exit, allowing Calico and Esmith to flee. Gurt came up with a different plan involving the bag of holding. so they bid Sable goodbye. 

The party was ambushed by a gang of sailors helmed by Baha, who still wanted revenge against Kai who she believed was behind the whale meat poisoning. The party dispatched the whalers, killing some and knocking others out, making the second in command flee. 

The party then went into the dark and slippery tunnels of the Undercity, venturing further deep hat they ever had, following a Guildless map to find the sea elf Moku they had learned aboit. They first encountered 3 would-be Tanawhu cultists who turned out to be Guildless elves without a purpose that Moku had taken under his wing. Kai's influence manage to get them on his side. 

Finally met Mokunaro who was dismissive and insulting towards Kai, rejecting his adoption by Kahwra and putting himself forward as the last of the Hakari. Kai summoned his tentacle to prove he was chosen by Tanawhu. Mokunaro started to see Kai as the potential champion of Tanawhu announced by his dreams and ask to travel with him to act as a guide.

Yazim hired an investigator though Lou in order to help track down his family. 

The party then met with Sable to discuss selling more healing potions, but found her displeased by their alliance with the Easons. Despite this, she offered to use her connections to bypass the mandatory ship inspection, allowing Calico and Esmith to escape undetected. Gurt, however, devised an alternative plan involving their bag of holding, leading the party to decline Sable's offer as they bid her farewell.

As they made their way through the city, the party found themselves ambushed by a gang of sailors led by Baha, who still harbored a grudge against Kai for the alleged whale meat poisoning incident. The ensuing skirmish saw the party swiftly overpower the whalers, with some falling in combat and others beaten into submission. The second-in-command, seeing the tide turn against them, fled the scene.

Following this encounter, the party delved deeper into the Undercity than ever before, navigating its dark and treacherous tunnels. Armed with a map provided by the Guildless, they sought out the enigmatic sea elf named Moku. Their journey first led them to three aspiring Tanawhu cultists, who turned out to be directionless Guildless elves taken under Moku's wing. Kai's charisma and connection to Tanawhu swayed these elves to his side.

At last, they came face to face with Mokunaro, the elusive sea elf. His reception was far from warm, as he dismissed and insulted Kai, rejecting the validity of his adoption by Kahwra and asserting himself as the last true Hakari. Kai, in a bold move to prove his divine connection, summoned his spectral tentacle. This display shifted Mokunaro's perspective dramatically. He began to see Kai as the potential champion of Tanawhu, fulfilling the prophecy from his dreams. In light of this revelation, Mokunaro requested to join Kai on his journey, offering to serve as a guide in the adventures to come.

This encounter not only provided Kai with a link to his adopted culture's past but also set the stage for new dynamics within the party as they prepared to leave Áine behind.

I apologize for not including all the details. You're absolutely right, and I'll make sure to use everything you provided. Here's a comprehensive summary that includes all the details you shared:

The party spent their final days in Áine tying up loose ends and planning their departure. They purchased goods to resell in the Republic, including spirits, spices, maps, and navigation instruments. While Yazim awaited news about his family, the group took on various jobs to earn extra money. Yazim helped organize a festival for Star Week, Kai worked security at the harbor and learned about the details of the exit process for ships, and Gurt repaired glass platforms in the Overcity, as a strike had left them short-handed.

As the Board finally admitted to the prison escape, questioning by guards became more open. On the third day, a disguised Gurt was brought to a guard station. However, he was questioned not about the prison break, but about his knowledge of the Vintage, suggesting the Wessons were after him.

The party decided to leave the next day. On their way to the harbor, they were attacked by an assassin. Gurt fled towards the harbor while Yazim and Kai attempted to eliminate the threat. Yazim was repeatedly poisoned by the killer's blades, but the two friends managed to kill the assassin.

They reunited at the harbor and submitted their manifest, not listing Gurt. As they waited on the ship for inspection, Gurt dove into the water with Jack and Esmith in the bag of holding. The inspector seemed to say everything was in order but warned them of an ethereal magical signature in the air. Gurt swam adeptly, despite poor visibility, recognizing currents, identifying the magical gates, and avoiding them before resurfacing far from the harbor, moments before the bag ran out of air.

In the captain's cabin, while questioning the cook, a high-pitched voice cursed them from the cook's mouth. It came from a sea louse attached to the cook's tongue.

With the threat neutralized, they continued their travel towards New Destiny.

The party's journey was interrupted when they spotted a Steorrian Green Salt Trading Company ship in the distance, seemingly abandoned. Approaching cautiously in a dinghy, they found the surrounding waters infested with sharks. The predators attacked, forcing the party to defend themselves. As they fought off the sharks, they noticed dead bodies floating in the water, likely the cause of the shark infestation.

After dealing with the immediate threat, the party climbed aboard the mysterious vessel. A grim scene awaited them - the entire crew had been brutally slaughtered. Their investigation led them to the captain's cabin, where they discovered a woman's body, stabbed in the back. To their surprise, they recognized her as Abigail Thorpe, a member of the pirate-hunting expedition that had been launched from Sealtham.

Further exploration yielded the captain's log, revealing crucial information. They learned the ship's name - the White Clam - and that another expedition ship had signaled a discovery with a blue flare. The log described an attack by a ship appearing suddenly from the fog, with the captain fleeing and Abigail attempting to defend the ship until the end.

Upon reaching New Destiny, the party found the inhabitants in high spirits, celebrating Calico Jack's return and eager to sign the Code that would officially establish the Republic. Wayne approached the party once more, inviting them to join. This led to extensive discussions among the party members and their crew, with Gurt voicing reservations. Eventually, they decided they would sign if they could add an article to the Code limiting harm to non-combatants.

The party then met with each captain to collect their reward and propose their addition to the Code. During these meetings, they encountered the mystic sea elf captain Luna Mahina. She shared a disturbing tale of her own ship being attacked by a pirate-hunting vessel, resulting in significant casualties among her crew. Luna expressed a strong desire for revenge.

As these events unfolded, New Destiny buzzed with preparations for the upcoming celebrations, the air thick with anticipation for the official declaration of the Republic and the potential inclusion of the party in this momentous occasion.
