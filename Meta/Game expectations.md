### Logistics
-  Scheduling: every other weeks, Fridays 7pm
-  Session length: 3-4 h
-  Campaign length: until summer at least
-  Locations: Pub; occasionally online or Ant's place in Crumlin 
-  Missing players: session will happen if at least 3 players (+DM) are present; missing characters will be side-lined or their absence justified in-story

### Setting overview
The campaign begins in the Jaw, a province on the Grand Isle, part of the archipelago known as the Islands. Two major powers dominate the region:
- **Selvea**: A local elven empire inspired by Mesoamerican civilisations and various fantasy interpretations of elves. Selveans revere a pantheon of nature deities and embrace the use of magic as part of their culture.
- **Steorr**: A distant kingdom inspired by classic fantasy and European powers of the early modern period. Steorr is home to humans, dwarves, elves and others who worship the Unwavering Star, a dark purplish celestial body steady through night and day. They consider it the one true god, valuing order and work. Steorrians are technologically advanced and generally abhor magic.

### Unique elements
- Historical inspiration: the campaign draws from the Age of Sail (1550–1850)
- Technology: gunpowder and magical technology exist, though their use varies across cultures and regions
- Magic: low-magic world, where magic exists but is rare, poorly understood, and perceived differently by various cultures
- Gods: deities are revered, but there’s no definite proof of their existence
- Ageing: characters age comparably to humans

### Themes
- New worlds and exploration
- Cultural and political conflict
- Identity and belonging
- Mystery and intrigue

### Tone
- Grounded but playful
- Morally complex
- Adventurous and swashbuckling

### Safety Tools
-  Before game: Lines and Veils
	-  Lines: contents players want to exclude from the plot completely (e.g. sexual assault, graphic cruelty to animals and children)
	-  Veils: topics which should only be part of the story in a softened, mitigated, implied form (e.g. consensual sex)
-  During game : Script Change
	-  Pause: Stop the game to ask questions and clarify details
	-  Rewind: Go back in time and adjust what has happened in the last few moments
	-  Fast forward: Quickly finish up the current scene or skip to the next one
-  After game: Star and Wishes
	-  Stars: Each player awards a star for a thing they loved about the game
	-  Wishes: Each player tells the table something they would like to see happen in a future session

### Game Style
- Sandboxy and player-driven game: key story hooks exist but the direction of the campaign depends on player choices and interests in the dynamic world of the campaign
- Collaborative worldbuilding: players are encouraged to invent details, build NPC relationships, and tie characters to the larger world   
- Player styles: respect differing play styles, emphasise teamwork,  and ensure everyone gets moments to shine
- Session style: mostly minis on a dry-erase grid, but also theatre of the mind and various VTTs for online play
- Player vs Player: PvP only with mutual agreement. Respect and consent are essential

### Mechanics
-  Using D&D 2024
-  Rule changes
	-  Character options
	-  Drinking a potion is bonus action
	-  One spell with a spell slot per turn
	-  Exhaustion: -2 to d20 rolls per level, -5ft  to speed per level
	-  Heroic Inspiration: reroll any die immediately after rolling, must use new roll
-  House rules and notes
	-  Death saving throws are private between player and DM
	-  Spell components matter. Material components with a cost cannot be replaced by a spellcasting focus
-  No fighting about rules: players can make their case but DM decision will be quick to move game forward
 Levelling plan: Session 1 will start at level 3
