[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=14) of Gaza you cannot tell me that they do not know who this guy is this is NCIS a real meat and potatoes cop show that's been running for 21 years and for most of that run it's been weirdly obsessed 
[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=27) with Israel this tape aired on Al jazer after SEL himself up along with nine Israeli civilians on a bus in Jerusalem it's the Joint Chiefs battle plans in the event of an attack on Israel officer

[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=46) Israel Israeli Israeli Espionage is all over NCIS with dozens of episodes that include mad which is basically the Israeli CIA you may have heard about mad recently as they were behind one of the 
[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=58) most aggressive and overt acts of Espionage in recent years news right now some 150 people have been wounded in Beirut suburbs and other parts of Lebanon after there handheld pagers 
[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=69) reportedly exploded today sources tell CNN the pager attack on Tuesday was a joint operation involving the Israel Defense Forces and the country's major spy agency the mosad across Lebanon on 
[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=82) Tuesday at around 3:30 in the afternoon thousands of pagers exploded almost at the same time scenes like this playing out hundreds of times across Lebanon within the space of an hour a targeted 
[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=94) coordinated highly technical attack on September 17th 2024 thousands of pagers in Lebanon and Syria exploded killing at least 42 people and wounding nearly 3500 this was the latest escalation in the 
[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=106) most recent chapter of the Israeli States ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza that hit high gear following the October 7th attacks in 20123 the pager attack was executed by mad against Hezbollah a 
[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=118) group that's been launching Rockets into Israel and demanding a ceasefire in Gaza but it's clear that a ton of Lebanese civilians were caught in the literal thousands of explosions these pagers 
[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=127) exploded while people were on the road uh going about their daily lives basically in in supermarkets and hospitals uh driving their cars getting their kids from school a lot of the 
[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=139) coverage of the attack described it with some amount of awe impressed by the incredible feat of engineering and spycraft that mad was able to pull off on October 7th the Israeli intelligence 
[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=148) Services came across as Johnny English completely dumbfounded and dumb struck today they look like James Bond a very modern form of unconventional warfare blamed on Israel so how much planning do 
[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=160) you think went into this sophisticated coordination involving this old school device the New York Times wrote that quote Israel demonstrated technical prowess and partly restored the aura of 
[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=171) its intelligence agencies ABC News wrote that the unassuming pager took its place in the annals of Israeli covert operations history the Washington post wrote as an act of spycraft it is 
[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=182) without parallel one of the most successful and inventive penetrations of an enemy by an intelligence service in recent history this is illustrative of a larger American Media Trend using very 
[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=192) different language to talk about Israeli military operations versus the actions of their enemies you know the terrorists Hezbollah had to come to the full realization of what had only been a 
[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=203) suspicion which is what if there's more now as an organization they have to look at every device they have figure figure out where it came from how they got it um and if it's compromised which means 
[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=214) paranoia and fear has to be very very high inside that organization yeah maybe put down the Game Boy I mean it's a violent attack with civilian casualties meant to inspire paranoia and fear maybe 
[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=226) you could describe it as an act of Terror you know if someone else did it now this is not a new observation many have noted how news media often uses selective grammar to emphasize certain 
[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=237) killings or deaths as Elena dudam puts it plainly for Time Magazine Palestinians seem to die at the hands of an invisible executioner Palestinians are shot dead Palestinians starve 
[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=248) Palestinian children are found dead Palestinians die they aren't killed as if their death is a fault of their own but how did we get here why does this blatant double standard go unchallenged 
[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=258) by so many well that brings us back to NCIS and one of its main characters Zea deid who are you Ze David mad you're Israeli 
[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=271) very good the way you made that connection mad Israeli Zea isn't just an Israeli on TV she is arguably the most prominent Israeli representation in the history of American television even to 
[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=283) this day although although to be fair it's not exactly a stacked field of competition while Zea left NCIS way back in season 11 she's periodically returned and there's even a spin-off scheduled 
[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=294) for 2025 called NCIS Zea and Tony Zea has been praised in Israeli and Jewish Publications across the Spectrum in 2012 the Jerusalem Post called her the boob tub's outstanding Israeli Patriot a 
[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=306) self-disciplined and self-reliant Zionist Warrior a virtual one-woman Army and a sharpshooter Guided by an uniring moral compass the forward wrote In 2011 that Zea is our most prominent 
[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=318) televisual Israeli helping in her own way to spread awareness of Israeli culture and all this kind of got me wondering how has this show shaped our understanding of Israel as an ally in 
[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=328) the war on terror their brutal methods and why so many seem blind to the ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and the regional war that seems primed to explode welcome to copaganda a series 
[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=340) of videos exploring the portrayal of the police on television and how that portrayal has shaped our understanding of who the police are and what they should be there's a playlist around here 
[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=349) somewhere turns out there's a lot of cop shows I don't know why I say that I know that it's always right up here today in a very special episode we're really not going to talk about policing that much I 
[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=358) mean NCIS does some police work but it's it's we we'll get to it it's complicated instead I want to look at the show's portrayal of mad and Israel because I think it can help us understand what 
[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=367) kind of thinking goes into supporting the current genocide in Gaza before we get into it a few things that this video is not it is not going to be a full history of Israel Palestine there are a 
[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=378) lot better people for that I'm just I'm just a TV guy second this is not a deep dive into NCIS at large because holy [ __ ] there is so much to be said about the forensics and the just general war 
[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=388) on terror stuff and a good lawyer could prove that but you're not getting a lawyer you're getting a transfer to a Naval Base in Cuba it's called GMO ever heard of it we're not here to talk about 
[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=399) that yet Perhaps in a future video patreon.com skip intro and finally while I'm going to be talking specifically about ncis's portrayal of Israel and Israeli politics that is separate from 
[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=410) Judaism critiquing the policies or actions of the nation state of Israel has nothing to do with the Jewish religion just like critiquing George W Bush's war on terror policies not 
[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=419) anti-christian even though he claimed that he was being led by his own brand of white jesus American and Israeli Jews are far from a monolith on this issue either groups like The Israeli Orthodox 
[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=430) netra Carta and the American group's Jewish voice for peace and if not now have been calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza since November 2023 there has long been Jewish resistance to 
[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=441) the occupation so I don't want to in any way conflate ethnic Jews with the decisions of the nation state of Israel trying to get the public to understand what we did in our military service so 
[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=451) they understand the prices of continuing the control of millions of Palestinians all right here we [Music] go let's start by talking a bit about 
[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=465) what NCIS is as a TV show how does it operate what what's its deal what's the deal with NCIS NCIS has been one of the top five most watch shows every year since 2008 and almost always the most 
[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=478) watch show once you take out Sunday night and Thursday night football and NCIS only has slightly more military propaganda thas again another sack for D Thomas the show has spawned a slew of 
[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=494) creatively titled spinoffs like NCIS laa NCIS New Orleans NCIS Hawaii NCIS Sydney and NCIS Origins I mean how do they come up with these even in the streaming age the series is still pulling in roughly 
[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=506) 10 million viewers per episode and there aren't even any original cast members left well okay McGee is still on the show but he's hardly recognizable cuz the whole OIC glow up and he's the 
[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=516) show's punching back so who really cares you're 5:00 McGee green SUV oh jeez Mi I kept it stey there's no way around it NCIS is one of the most popular shows in the history of American 
[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=532) television all while routinely being a punching bag for other comedies all the greatest detective shows are focused around a Central usually titular character code Jack monk ncas who's 
[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=544) nicas you know nicas sometimes he goes to Los Angeles sometimes he goes to New Orleans are you do you mean NCIS no hang on recent breakup fanny pack cat quick who is the lead character 
[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=558) on NCIS special agent Jethro Gibbs in your office now so sorry man we're prepping for a movie this is gritty Indie flick we play soldiers trying to adjust to life back home seriously 
[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=568) you've never seen NCIS LA while technically it's a police procedural NCIS is a little different from most cop shows whereas many shows focus on cops taking to the streets interviewing 
[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=578) Witnesses and Gathering evidence most of the police work on NCIS is done from a lab or an office the focus is on magical forensics and surveillance the kind of stuff that most people realize is kind 
[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=590) of [ __ ] can you pull up the bullet trajectory data [Music] wow plus I really got to get one of these obviously budget's permitting this 
[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=607) a single Source wow it's like if Sports Center covered terrorism you know other than football football is a war crime while there's a lot to be said about forensics again we're going to save that 
[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=617) for another video what we need to know here is the result of all that lab work NCIS mostly takes place in an office making it more like a light-hearted workplace drama than a hardboiled cop 
[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=627) show the driving force isn't really the Episode by episode cases but rather the inner relationships of the team it's a bit more of a Sentimental show than you'd expect like Fast INF Furious or 
[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=636) the Olive Garden when you're here it's your family dad this is why I don't want Tim driving my car you know I told Tim that that's 
[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=646) my car and and it's not a family car it's my car Gibbs is the patriarchal badge daddy a marine sniper suppressing his emotions kind of like my dad while guzzling coffee and hitting his kids 
[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=657) like he's Red Foreman on that 70 show Gibbs is never wrong because well he's the main character he's not in the Middle East he is here where'd you get that 
[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=669) Intel my gut Tony dooso is his misbehaving eldest son a self-described wild card and connoisseur of workplace sexual harassment yes yes dating was tough you need any help with that now 
[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=681) Paula no Tony thank you I've been there and I've done that quick question the pink ones do they taste like strawberry thought you said you weren't seeing anyone Tim McGee plays the computer tech 
[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=693) nerd who uses the weight of the American surveillance state to solve crimes from the comfort of his own desk desperately vying for the fatherly approval that he'll never get and last but certainly 
[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=702) not least is Zea deid the adopted hot isra lady assassin princess of the family the clear favorite of Gibbs probably because she's so good at killing people I've always sensed that 
[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=712) there's a strong bond between the two of you something shared [Music] perhaps she proved herself see McGee that's the way to get to his heart 
[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=733) murder get off your laptop and just start shooting some people that Family Focus and the physical distance from crime helps obscure the fact that nobody seems to really know what NCIS is in 
[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=743) real life are they cops are they soldiers o maybe they're magic crime fairies what's NCIS can't believe some people have never heard of us if you haven't seen 
[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=754) the show or just never bothered to pay attention NCIS is a real life organization the naval criminal investigative service they're in charge of investigating any deaths of Navy 
[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=764) personnel that aren't ruled natural causes that's their main thing but despite being a fairly small Federal agency they're only about 12250 agents they also have this insanely broad 
[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=774) Mandate of Counter Intelligence counterterrorism cyber warfare National Security and the prote of US Naval assets worldwide it's expansive the best way to think about NCIS is that they're 
[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=783) like all those other deep State three-letter acronyms NSA DEA CIA FBI IC ATF Etc but NCIS is different because they have four letters Federal authorities they mean us four stinking 
[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=800) letters NCIS this broad mandate is very well represented on the show one week they'll be investigating the fake suicide murder of a marine the next they'll be hunting down a Cold Case 
[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=810) serial killer and in another they'll be doing a rescue operation in Somalia they're literally all over the place well this is how the real life NCIS operates I think there's something 
[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=820) problematic about the way the show mixes counterterrorism work with what we would consider common policing sometimes you'll be watching an investigation into a pretty standard crime you'd find on 
[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=829) any cop show only for it to suddenly turn into a terrorist hunt so a robbery depends free m don't move cars wired to explode as scholar Ivon Tasker wrote in 2012 the show depends on 
[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=846) a fluid understanding of the boundaries between different types of crime terrorism is as often motivated by personal as political concerns and investigations of routine crimes such as 
[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=856) drug dealing can lead the team to concerns of National Security whereas what initially seems to be a case of terrorism masks themes of adultery and sexual jealousy very familiar to viewers 
[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=866) of the crime drama so between the blurring of the crimes and the distance from those crimes and the family aspect as opposed to the mystery aspect you get this kind of central ambiguity on NCIS 
[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=878) they really don't want you thinking too hard about anything the show has an almost code switching ability that allows it to dip in and out of the Spy genre or the crime genre or the 
[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=888) workplace sitcom in a way that obscures just how little information they give us about what's actually going on with their enemies often they're portrayed as extremists falling into one of two camps 
[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=899) they're either unrelatable monsters who just love death and that works for you for anell crazy terrorist kills himself can't really understand that mentality doesn't mean I can't accept it 
[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=910) or they're just in it for some selfish reason whether that's money or or Revenge understand my feelings about Israel are far from political and hardly personal it's strictly business hell my 
[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=922) own attorney is a Jew the showe never wants to Grapple with any kind of ideology except to hit basic talking points about them usually involving some number of virgins bohamed last night he 
[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=932) died for rivers of honey and 72 virgins maybe he wanted to make sure that he got the 70 virgins instead of some Muslim with an alias he used well he's not in it for the 70 virgins you'd have no 
[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=941) trouble attracting women it's always it's always the virgins while we are going to primarily focus on Arab coded terrorists in this video since they're the ones that come up in Mad plot lines 
[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=951) it's important to note that NCIS has a pretty wide distribution of crazy bad guys so to see how this Dynamic plays out on a more neutral playing field let's look at season 9 villain Harper 
[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=961) Dearing a venture capital CEO who becomes a terrorist after his son a Navy sailor dies in an explosion because his ship wasn't up to spec so he becomes a terrorist trying to blow up American 
[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=972) vessels in order to show off how dangerous they are the terrorist attack that killed my son Evan did not need to happen these recent attacks the vulnerabilities that I have pointed out 
[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=984) they needed to be disclosed sacrificing a few I have have saved thousands of lives I mean who Among Us hasn't been there this motive kind of morphs into a more personal Vendetta against agent 
[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=996) Gibbs because Gibbs is the hero of the story I I truly think that's about as deep as it goes you have a job to do Gibs I've done mine as media critic Robert applebomb described the episode 
[16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1015) in 2019 however implausible the story not the story of during's anger but of what he plans and accomplishes when he acts upon it it falls into line with a conventional interpretation of terrorist 
[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1025) violence its main spring being resentment and frustration focusing his attention on one man who has actually had nothing to do with his son's death and thus displacing his anger from an 
[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1035) institution onto an individual or perhaps to a suicidal pact another conventional feature of terrorist violence the show has very little interest in understanding their enemies 
[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1045) and viewers are kind of just expected to take everything as a given of nature America is good so our enemies are bad why are they bad because they're not us and also they're crazy and violent which 
[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1058) we definitely aren't you have no rights you're a terrorist on a US Navy ship and we're invoking the Patriot Act in an hour you're going to be flown off this ship escorted by agent David and myself 
[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1070) to Aviano Airbase where you're going to board a c 37a and you're going to be flown to Guantanamo Bay Cuba once there you're going to be staying at a Sunny little seaside resort the locals call 
[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1082) gitmo heard a nasty rumor about what goes on down there on NCIS terrorism is kind of just a thing that's always happening a thing that the agents have to handle like any other natural 
[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1092) disaster just like there's no way to reduce the number of tornadoes the best we can do is just limit the Damage Done by them but this brings us back to our main question why does a lazily written 
[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1105) CVS deep State procedural have so much to say about is really spies did I miss the memo is this NCIS Tel Aviv I've been watching the first major character from Israel introduced on the show isn't 
[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1121) actually Zea it's a man named Ary hesari and he is not a friend to the team long story short Ary is a deep cover Massad agent infiltrating Hamas and while he was trying to get inside he 
[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1136) had to do some bad guy terrorists things to look like he was a bad guy terrorist Zea is sent in as his Handler and to get him out of hot water with any local law enforcement at least that's what mad 
[19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1147) thinks in reality Arie is half Israeli and half Palestinian and has chosen his Palestinian side and joined tamas although the show like we laid out before pretty light on the details of 
[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1157) his motivation one has to wonder what made him such a sades I don't give a damn I just want to kill the bastard hey I I told you it was an uncurious show Ary ends up explaining that he joined 
[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1169) Hamas because his father the director of msad killed his Palestinian mother and now he's a double double agent it was a retaliatory Israeli strike on the day I was in Tel 
[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1181) Aviv visiting him the Decades of planning he had his mle in her M he never knew how much I hated him yeah I almost feel sorry for you is that a triple agent or a quadruple agent not 
[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1195) not a math guy but AR's explanation is literally just this two-minute scene at the end of a multi-episode multi-season multi-year Arc the show spends just as much time wondering if maybe he's just 
[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1206) an adrenaline junkie he needs to face death to feel alive maybe to feel anything or maybe it's because he has a personal Vendetta against Gibbs because Ary is so 
[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1219) threatened by gibbs' hyper masculine centerp part we now think he's here for more personal reasons he's planning on killing Gibbs in the end Z is convinced that Ary has 
[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1229) turned and kills him to save Gibbs and then the plot twist when Zea reveals this he's my half brother show literally sounds like Jane the Virgin when I explain it anyways 
[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1242) that's Zea's introduction to the team and she joins NCIS as a liaison to mad as a character Zea is Stern and tough she's reserved she's smart she's fiercely loyal and Hyper capable 
[20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1254) something the show frequently credits to her massage training shouldn't feel bad I was trained by the best you know that's what I like about mad our training modesty but the most important 
[21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1267) detail about Zea she's hot you're sweating it's hot in here I had not noticed really I'm not just saying that her sex appeal was literally the entire 
[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1280) focus of the character creation process after actress Sasha Alexander left the show in 2005 producers needed a new girl but didn't really have much to go on other than that as Creator Donald 
[21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1290) Bellisario told tv.com quote I want to go for a European or Australian girl who is very comfortable with her femininity and sexuality when actress coach to depablo auditioned for the part the 
[21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1300) actor who plays Tony dooso Michael Weatherly deviated from the script pushing her hair behind her ear and saying my God you are so pretty you remind me of Salma hyek As depablo Told 
[21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1311) her Alma moer Carnegie melon my primary thought was don't let this guy get physically close to you and at that moment everybody in the room room started laughing and thought it was the 
[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1320) funniest thing in the world because the chemistry between the two characters was perfect impressed with how she dealt with Weatherly going off script and being generally creepy they gave her the 
[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1329) job and insisted that she'd not take a cab ride home but instead ride with Weatherly so they could work on their chemistry toblo resisted but eventually she was kind of forced into it Carnegie 
[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1340) melon quotes Weatherly talking about the car ride like this initially I thought wow this is a frosty unfriendly almost mean girl but by the end of it I dro dropped her off and thought wow she's 
[22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1350) kind of sweet deep down so to recap uh the showrunners of NCIS were looking for a girl and the only thing they had to go on was that she had to be a hot Foreigner and had to be cool with creepy 
[22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1362) co-stars got it I tell this story to illustrate just how much the core of Zea's character is to be eye candy that can give a feisty retort to [Music] 
[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1372) misogyny ever been tied up by a woman before huh did you like it and today's not your lucky day and the details about her being Israeli and 
[23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1385) part of mad were an afterthought this one trck mind on her being hot first and foremost is even further highlighted by the fact that Depo isn't Israeli she's Chilean which is let me check my map 
[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1397) almost literally could not be further away from Israel as the Jerusalem Post reported in 2007 depablo quote spent the first 10 years of her life in Santiago the eldest daughter of an upper class 
[23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1408) right-wing family and given the social stratification of Chilean society never met a Jewish child or for that matter any poor people despite this background Depo actually thinks she's a she's a

[27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1674) visit Israel and learn about their Heritage it is the largest education tourism organization in the world with about 20% of American Jews between the ages of 18 and 46 having taken the trip 
[28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1685) while the trip is ostensibly about introducing tourists to historic sites and learning about Israeli culture that's not the only goal as kiar Feldman wrote in the nation in 2011 quote the 
[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1695) common denominator of Birthright experience is the promotion by turns winking and overt of flings among participants or between participants and soldiers no problem if there's intimate

[28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1716) non-participants Birthright was conceived of by yasi Balin an Israeli politician who felt that intermarriage was diluting Jewish identity and wanted to create a situation where spouses are 
[28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1727) available that's why Birthright only accepts applicants between the ages of 18 and 26 for fertility reasons hey did you know that a woman's fertility starts to decrease about the age of 25 and it's 
[28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1739) not like Birthright is a political Feldman writes that quote no longer is it simply a project to shore up Jewish identity Birthright has joined the fight for the political loyalties of young

[29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1778) does by refusing to discuss show the occupation or even allow us to hear from Palestinians um what it's really doing is is hiding the occupation from Young American Jews like myself now I'm not 
[29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1790) saying you're a bad person if you went on or enjoyed a Birthright trip they look fun as hell who wouldn't want hot people thrown at you while you're encouraged to [ __ ] them all in what is 
[29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1799) likely the first international trip you've ever taken without your parents that sounds like the beginning of a pretty rad 2000s party movie what I am saying is that trying to manipulate how 
[30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1808) people breed in order to create some pure undiluted race of people just kind of gives me the heebie gbes it it never seems to work out well and I think that when we look at Zea whose two defining 
[30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1818) characteristics are being hot and being an Israeli assassin we start to head towards some uh troubling territory the Israeli State often uses women soldiers to contrast between them and the 
[30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1829) comparative sexual repression of their Arab neighbors portraying Israel as a protector of women and the queer [Music] [Applause] 
[30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1843) [Music] community and while Israeli law is certainly more Progressive on some of these issues it's not like they're only dropping bombs on siset Palestinian men 
[30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1856) they're not smashing the matriarchy speaking of sex NCIS can't shut the [ __ ] up about it why don't you visualize her naked does she intimidate you woman hasn't been born yet who can

[31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1879) a defining feature of NCIS as a TV show oh uh well women Tony is constantly hitting on women and creepy ways and female co-workers are routinely dismissed or 
[31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1891) bulldozed by their male colleagues any problem taking orders from me as director or as a woman L easy H she was just doing what she was told you do not get to determine what is worth sharing 
[31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1902) and what is not I don't answer to you agent Gibbs yes you do yes you do on the job it is director Shepherd or ma'am okay what about off the job there won't be any off

[32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1928) misogyny I couldn't decide between childish Juvenile and just plain old annoying it's true and you you know better but you're so busy playing the faithful sidekick you just go along for 
[32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1940) the ride Gibbs and ducky embrace the label chauvinist just face it Jethro you and I are a couple of old chauvinists women will never be equal in our eyes until they're equal in death boy I bet 
[32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1954) they're really into Andrew Tate today speaking of an alleged sex criminal it should be noted that Michael Weatherly has been involved in some really gross workplace sexual harassment actress 
[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1963) paully pet accused star Mark Harmon of attacking her and also that the showrunner for NCIS New Orleans was fired for his own brand of sexual misconduct but the jokes the team makes 
[32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1973) are accompanied by quirky music so they're actually just funny SE exist first things first got to narrow down perspective agents it's got to be a woman those are just a women are there 
[33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=1982) photos in here boss boss really Tony pics because you know coming from anyone else that might be considered a laps in judgment okay you both picked that makes much more sense you don't trust me to be

[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2023) bringing this up to dunk on ncis's sexism because there's a pretty disgusting sexist Spectrum on the show when it comes to the Israelis on the show they're portrayed as sex positive 
[33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2033) and sexually active am I sensing something between the two of you nothing serious you haven't slept together then well of course we are sleeping together it's just nothing 
[34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2044) serious got to get back to Israel and when it comes to the Arabs on the show they're portrayed as hyp sexist and Hyper misogynist director Vance's wife was caught in the crossfire fanis woman 
[34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2054) is dead as well her name was Jackie being slapped by a woman is twice the insult of a s she doesn't know why should she she's just a woman women should never get involved in politics 
[34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2065) it's a waste of beauty you are a woman you're a genius I have no problem with women but I cannot vouch for my men but really this is all the same harassment and misogyny right the Americans 
[34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2081) Israelis and Arabs are all engaging in the same kind of sexism but it's portrayed on a kind of sliding scale of acceptability crucially with Americans at the top of the ethical ladder excuse 
[34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2091) me Ary is a chauvinist he is taking out the women I work with before me give I thought you were proud to be a chauvinist yourself game recognize game I guess the point is that it is 
[35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2102) literally the same behavior identified for being that behavior but with the gravity of the accusation having everything to do with the color of that character's skin and this weird moral 
[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2112) hierarchy isn't just reserved for sex it's also the best way to view the show's perspective on violence and Middle Eastern [Music] 
[35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2124) geopolitics for as much as mad and Israel are represent Ed on NCIS the show's portrayal of them is far from glowing instead you might actually be surprised to learn that it's pretty 
[35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2135) antagonistic right from the jump as I mentioned earlier the Show's first portrayal of a Mad agent is Ary haswari who turns out to be a double agent working for Hamas when Zea shows up to 
[35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2144) handle the situation Gibbs immediately confronts her with this that's all we ask don't kill the wrong man like mad did in Norway that mistake cost us dearly not as dearly as the Palestinian 
[35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2154) waiter you killed now what Gibbs is referring to is known as The Lily Hammer Affair where in 1973 mad operatives assassinated a Moroccan waiter not a Palestinian in Norway shooting him 13 
[36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2166) times in front of his wife turns out they had the wrong guy mistaking him for a Palestinian militant an honest mistake you know he was brown the guy they were looking for was brown they're not even 
[36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2177) from the same continent it was an international incident a Norwegian law enforcement captured and convicted several of the Mad agents involved so Gibbs bringing this up is pretty hostile 
[36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2187) right at the very least it brings up a massive Israeli [ __ ] and highlights an assassination program that has been internationally criticized according to New York Times magazine writer Ronan 
[36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2196) Bergman since World War II Israel has used assassination and targeted killing more than any other country in the West in many cases endangering the lives of civilians just this year Israeli 
[36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2208) assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders have been carried out by air strikes killing dozens in the process all these are the scenes overnight of the camp in Rafa set Ablaze the Israeli 
[36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2219) military claim two CN Hamas officials were killed in the strike with what they called prise Munitions local officials say most of the casualties were women and children hell in mad's decades long 
[37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2232) quest to assassinate Palestinian leader yaser Arafat Former Defense Minister Ariel Chiron even ordered an attack on a commercial plane carrying a doctor 30 children and crucially not yaser Arafat 
[37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2244) thankfully the mission leader called the air strike off but if you haven't noticed that hasn't exactly stopped the Israeli military from bombing hospitals or refugee camps in the years since 
[37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2253) Hospital workers over over the past 12 months as well as as having to deal with the most horrific of injuries that they're tending to have also had to evacuate have had to pack up time and 
[37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2265) time again as a result of evacuation orders as a result of fighting NCIS definitely highlights this kind of recklessness and collateral damage often depicting mad operations with big 
[38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2287) explosions mad operations are not only messy Ary is far from the only Shady agent in their ranks Zea and AR's father the head of mad Eli deid sends an agent named Michael rivkin to spy on an 
[38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2300) American intelligence Summit where he actually kills an ice agent to avoid being discovered dead man is ice that's cold immigration Customs Enforcement oh no think of all the families that ice 
[38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2313) agent won't be able to rip apart and in classic messy NCIS style the show also R conon Zea's introduction to the team as a covert Mission her father Center on assassinating Ary in order to gain 
[38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2323) gibbs's trust and provide intelligence back to mad from inside NCIS Harry was out of control so Zea's father sent her to eliminate him she kills Ary earns your trust two 
[38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2336) birds one bullet it really does sound like a deep stay telen Noll in the 10th season NCIS hunts down a rogue Massad agent named Elon bodnar who assassinated Eli and tried to frame Iranian 
[39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2349) intelligence so that he could become the new director of mad which is how that would work mad claims Bodner acted alone the Israelis are as anxious to find him as we are he hired the Hitman but when 
[39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2359) ases took himself out Bodner finished the job himself depending on you take out sa take over as director of mad so I wouldn't say that this portrayal mad or Israel is uh kind NCIS even engages in a 
[39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2371) pretty boring and tired anti-semitic Trope where the show brings into question Zea's dual loyalties to Israel and to NCIS giving more Credence to the idea that this show is maybe not all 
[39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2382) that fond of Israel are you by any chance questioning my loyalty I'm worried because you don't seem to understand that your secret friend is interfering with this agency's ability 
[39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2392) to shut down a terrorist cell you've been in the service of two masters for too long you're to your father and mad predates anything else because Eva I don't know who you answer to anymore 
[40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2403) NCIS or mad what is it you expect from me I expect your loyalty to me and only me but in classic code switching NCI fashion the show morphs this anti-semitic Trope of dual loyalties 
[40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2417) into a more purely misogynistic one you see Zea's dad is Eli deid the head of msad but her adopted dad is Gibbs Eli is all but dead to me and the closest thing I 
[40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2432) have to a father is accusing me as critic Eaton kensky summed it up in 2011 quote she's not loyal to a tradition or a nation but to a daddy I'm telling you these writers 
[40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2446) literally cannot comprehend someone believing in something but the tense relationship portrayed on NCIS between American and Israeli intelligence is pretty historically accurate in the 
[40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2455) 1960s the Kennedy Administration sought intelligence over the Israeli nuclear program in 1984 actual NCIS agent Jonathan Pard was revealed to have been stealing classified material from Assad 
[41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2466) the US has periodically criticized Israeli intelligence for targeted killings and the Snowden leaks revealed that American and British spies had targeted the Israeli Prime Minister 
[41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2475) likewise in 2019 Israel was accused of planting listening devices inside the White House Trump was unbothered but despite this history you'd be wrong to think that Israeli intelligence is 
[41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2486) viewed as anything but our closest and most abusive partner those Snowden leaks also reveal that the NSA shares its raw unredacted data of American civilians with Israel as the guardian reported in 
[41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2497) 2013 quote but the memorandum makes clear that the information shared with Israelis would be in its pre- minimized State Israel is allowed to receive raw sigint signal intelligence including but 
[41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2509) not limited to unevaluated and un minimized transcripts gists the similes tect voice and digital Network intelligence metadata and content and like in real life NCIS and mad remain 
[42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2521) close throughout the show's history despite the many uh many betrayals sometimes patience is a necessity otherwise you end up making an enemy out of your 
[42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2531) friend and then we end up with a dead American and a dead Israeli and I know that's the last thing either one of us wants at no point is Israeli Ally ship ever in question even when they've 
[42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2541) killed an American law enforcement agent in an attempt to spy on an intelligence Summit that that feels like a big deal oh I understand Eli I don't judge you I never have sure NCIS shows that they're 
[42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2554) messy both in terms of their targeted killings and in terms of their loyalty but Zea is always the main contact and she plays the role of a good immigrant the kind of person who can be reformed 
[42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2564) and shown the American way eventually quitting mad and becoming a full-fledged NCIS agent and while the show presents us criticisms of Israeli policy we can see that same moral hierarchy here that 
[42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2575) we saw with misogyny and sex you can hear it in the way that the show talks about mad and Hamas using the exact same language Hamas is like the mafia they never trust anyone outside the family SS 
[43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2587) like the mafia one big happy family when NCIS operates like a big happy incestuous family that's great but when non-americans do it it's it's the mafia when it comes to violence it's even more 
[43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2598) blatant Palestinians oh they just they love killing people and they don't care who else they hurt in the process Wars are measured in body counts the news carries a running 
[43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2609) tally you change the world with rivers of blood there is no reason to kill just one person Israelis are portrayed as loving violence too with the show 
[43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2623) especially hammering home the idea that Eli deid is a monster for training his children to be Assassins but most of the time the others I can feel them looking at me and silently wondering how can a 
[43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2634) father possibly raise his daughter to be a professional killer but in a gesture the show never offers to Arabs it goes out of its way to tell us that the Israelis are only so violent because you 
[44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2644) couldn't possibly understand the pressure they're under the view from where I sit is quite different the threats are immediate every day is a fight to 
[44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2654) survive it is my dream that my daughter will not have to make that decision with her sons and her daughters I am saddled with responsibilities that you cannot possibly fathom the safety of a Nation 
[44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2666) when every one of our neighbors wants us dead and the Americans well it's no accident that Gibbs is a sniper looks sweet the way you hold that boss a kind of symbol of precise clean violence he 
[44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2676) can come and go without a trace killing only the crazy bad guys and nobody else remember when I told you my boss was a sniper on NCIS when we do violence it's unambiguously Justified oh jeez well all 
[44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2698) I can say is if we killed them they must have been bad guys when the Israelis do it it's not good but you know it's necessary I don't have the luxury of allowing my feelings to dictate my 
[45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2708) actions and when the bad guys do it well that's just that's just evidence that they're evil how can you support any group that lets their children blow themselves up their leaders say that 
[45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2716) suicide bombers are all they have to fight with sir when Hamas leaders start blowing themselves up I'll consider it ah yes because our president is always on the front lines we don't send 
[45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2727) children but we do send 18-year-olds that can't afford to go to college No Child Left Behind threatened to cut Federal funding from schools that didn't give military recruiters private student 
[45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2735) information No Child Left Behind guarantees Schools Federal funding as long as they Grant recruiters access to students on campus unlike the rest of us who have to show ID recruiters can walk 
[45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2748) right in no questions asked I mean check out these military recruiters reaching out to literal children at a gaming convention the Army is here at one of the world's top gaming expose to 
[45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2758) Showcase its latest recruitment tool the US Army Esports team maybe as good as me one day their goal turning virtual Fighters into real soldiers the newest Call of Duty Black 
[46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2773) Ops is literally about how we need to take out Saddam Hussein before he unleashes weapons of mass destruction where have I heard that before year after year Saddam Hussein has gone to 
[46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2784) elaborate lengths spend enormous SU s taking great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction luckily saddam's wmds and Call of Duty are obviously fictional it's a video game 
[46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2796) but you know so were they in real life those weapons of mass destruction got to be somewhere when we do it it's recruitment when brown people do it it's brainwashing and when Israel does it 
[46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2806) it's kind of intense but I don't know maybe I would do that too who's to say it's really [Music] complicated if you've ever engaged with 
[46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2816) anything involv Israel and Palestine you've probably heard it described with the word complicated these nations Israel and Palestine have 75 years of ongoing tensions and conflict beginning 
[47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2826) in the mid 20th century until now and it's very complicated of all the regions in the world none may have as complicated a history as the Middle East it's basically impossible to predict 
[47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2837) what's going to happen in a place this complicated sure people are largely not in favor of the Israeli military bombing the streets of Gaza killing thousands of innocent women and children but they're 
[47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2847) also not in favor of attacks like the ones on October 7th for the same reasons plus doesn't Israel have a right to exist don't we owe the Jewish people a safe Homeland after the horror that was 
[47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2857) the Holocaust and someone else brings up the Noca and the decades long ethnic cleansing campaign and the Gaza Strip and the mission to push Palestinians out of the West Bank through Colonial 
[47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2866) settlements and you kind of just throw your hands up in the air and say h it's just really complicated if we're being as charitable as possible I think this is the kind of opinion that NCIS leaves 
[47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2875) its viewers with sure sure mad is sketchy and bad but so are the terrorists they're both bad I don't support either this is a sentiment that's very popular in America claiming 
[48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2887) some kind of neutrality while also wondering if I don't know maybe it's okay since those guys are even worse okay real quick you don't think that I support Israel do you I don't but I 
[48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2899) think that no I don't think you support Israel but I think you saying that like Palestinians are uh Palestinians are are immoral or evil or have an evil Antiquated uh culture or are barbaric is 
[48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2913) not only a historical what's up I do I do think that you can hear it when activists protesting for a ceasefire or arms embargo are confronted with the but do you condemn Hamas you support hamash 
[48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2926) do you not I Senator oddly enough I'm going to say thank you for that question because it demonstrates the purpose of our hearing today in a very 
[48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2936) yes or no Hamas is a foreign terrorist organization that I do not support but you asking the executive director of The arab-american Institute that question very much puts the focus on the issue of 
[49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2947) hate in our country and I think that the general ambiguity of ncis's plot feeds into this is mad on our side are they good are they bad well it's complicated if you're just focusing on the show's 
[49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2958) portrayal of Israel and mad it's tempting to view this as muddying the waters next time viewers see a debate about Israeli military policy and they think think back to the only exposure 
[49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2967) they've ever had to that organization a CBS TV show called NCIS they'll throw up their hands and say I don't know it's it's complicated this is the prevailing opinion in the United States according 
[49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2977) to an October 2024 Pew research poll 36% of Americans said that they weren't sure if Israel was going too far or not in its military operations more than any other response but it's complicated is a 
[49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2989) thought terminating cliche that only serves the status quo because what this portrayal glosses over is the fact that the United States is not a neutral Observer here because 
[49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=2999) you know what's not complicated United States military aid to Israel since October 7th the Biden Administration has sent a record $17.9 billion in military aid to Israel and politicians of both 
[50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3011) parties support unconditional ongoing Aid even as the Israeli military uses American Munitions to commit war crimes Amnesty International has documented a pattern of unlawful attacks by Israeli 
[50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3022) forces in the occupied Gaza Strip including indiscriminate attacks that failed to distinguish between civilians and Military objectives and which caused Mass civilian casualties and this isn't 
[50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3032) a new development axios estimates that more than 80% of Israel weapon imports from 1950 to 2020 were from the US and that the US foreign military financing represents around 15% of Israel's 
[50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3044) defense budget in recent years Israel has received more than twice as much military aid from the United States as any other country has since 1946 according to the Council on Foreign 
[50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3054) Relations during that same time period the Israeli military has routinely conducted not just targeted killings but attacks that deliberately Target densely populated communities in downtown 
[51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3065) buildings yet despite this asymmetry $18 billion in Aid to the Israeli military and less than 3% that total for humanitarian Aid in Gaza American Media repeatedly covers Palestine in a way 
[51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3076) that they would never refer to Israel here's CNN host Jake Tapper saying that the deaths of Palestinian civilians is unfortunate but really Hamas forced Israel to bomb heavily populated areas 
[51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3087) right did they not anticipate IL Israel would retaliate in a way that would cause innocent Palestinians in Gaza to die especially given the fact that as has been established by Israeli 
[51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3101) intelligence us intelligence and journalists who have visited Gaza the fact that Hamas embeds within the Palestinian population compare that to CNN's coverage of Iran's missile strike 
[51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3111) on Israel which is portrayed as a dangerous escalation of violence that among the targets were Israeli airfields but also and this is crucial the headquarters of mad the the 
[52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3122) international intelligence service of Israel which is inside Tel Aviv it's in the northern part of Tel Aviv but it's in the city it's in a densely populated area uh and of course the concern is if 
[52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3134) you're firing even even though Iran might consider that a military Target it is in a densely populated city uh with civilians around it dare I say it's embedded the Hamas embeded heads within 
[52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3147) the Palestinian population it seems like the Israeli military is never to blame for the bombs they drop whereas the innocent Palestinians well they get they just got to die and if they have a 
[52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3156) problem with that they should probably take it up with Hamas they think that even though they're the government of Gaza it's not their responsibility to protect Palestinian civilians the 
[52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3164) tunnels are for themselves for fighting the kids of Gaza just got to vote out Hamas already I mean once they get old enough to vote vote harder am I so out of 
[52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3174) touch no is the children who were wrong and despite some empathetic rhetoric about Palestinian civilians being killed given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian 
[53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3185) casualties and displacement in Lebanon it is devastating the Biden Administration has been steadfast in its commitment to unconditional military aid to Israel ultimately dismissing the 
[53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3195) massive leverage the US has to end this conflict a threat to withhold Aid could end this stage of the genocide tomorrow and while the Administration has publicly suggested this idea the Harris 
[53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3206) campaign assured Zionist voters in Michigan that they didn't really mean it as The Times of Israel reported a representative called it quote a political gesture that did not reflect 
[53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3214) any change in policy in the administration but the Biden Administration recently admitted that the only way they want this to end is with the complete destruction of Hamas 
[53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3224) we've never wanted to see a diplomatic resolution with Hamas well okay well well what about the ceasefire we wanted to see a ceasefire but we have always been Comm we we have always been 
[53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3233) committed to um the destruction of Hamas and this comes while Israeli officials have repeatedly claimed that there is no difference between Palestinian citizens and Hamas conent Deputy speaker Nissim 
[54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3244) vat said that the goal of the operation was quote erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth after having been blocked already for calling followers to quote burn Gaza now nothing less the 
[54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3257) Israeli defense minister even characterized the siege of Gaza in 2023 as quote fighting Human animals and Kash and Maz the Israeli government has even posted 
[54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3276) and promoted on their official account in a now deleted video that there are no innocent civilians in Gaza on October 7th many Gaz and civilians participated in killing raping and 
[54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3290) looting the Optics of the Israeli campaign in Gaza and now Lebanon are so horrific that they require this kind of double speak in order to maintain support for example President Biden 
[55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3300) postured publicly that he was dismayed by the escalation of violence and long sought to avoid it but this is one of those situations where if he wanted to he would ladies withhold Aid that is 
[55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3312) instead just like the way ncis's criticisms of the Israeli intelligence machine don't actually mean anything Biden's posturing is just that posturing because recent reports show that the 
[55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3322) administration was actually a okay with a ground Invasion all along the violence needs to be publicly condemned sure but it also must continue because those victims of violence are even worse they 
[55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3333) would do so much worse to us if they could just trust me on this did you make love to her and then blew her brains up she would do the same to me those kids they 
[55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3345) must just be born bad it's in their jeans meanwhile the American state has a long history of cracking down on Pro Palestine protests 1979 4 years after being publicly called out for illegally 
[55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3357) surveilling and infiltrating American political and civil rights organizations the FBI did the exact same thing again to the general Union of Palestinian students finding no evidence of 
[56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3367) terrorism but still monitoring the group for 10 years purely for political speech according to a 2012 Associated Press report the NYPD surveilled Muslim college students across the Northeast us 
[56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3377) without a warrant far beyond their jurisdiction including in Pennsylvania and Connecticut often without any evidence of any wrongdoing one officer after haing a group of students across 
[56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3387) the state noted some very suspicious activity namely that quote the group prayed at least four times a day and much of the conversation was spent discussing Islam and was religious in 
[56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3396) nature in other words they were being surveilled for being Muslim which is illegal theoretically and if you think this has gotten better since the October 7th 
[56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3408) attacks you can just turn off the video now I'm not going to reach you this year Elon Pape an anti-zionist Israeli historian Professor was detained and interrogated by Homeland Security about 
[56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3419) whether he was a supporter of Hamas whether he thought Israel was committing a genocide and what his solution in the Middle East was he was also asked to name names of Arab and Muslim friends 
[57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3430) just this year Mike Turner the Republican chairman of the house intelligence committee used this anti-palestinian animist to defend warrantless spying on US citizens 
[57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3438) according to a report from wired his presentation implied that New York protesters demanding that the US halt weapon sales to Israel were responding quote to what appears to be a Hamas 
[57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3448) solicitation while arguing against an amendment that would force the FBI to get warrants before collecting phone calls emails and texts of Americans although that's largely a technicality 
[57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3458) because as one Republican legislative director who was quoted in the piece noted yeah it's true you can't Target protesters under 702 but that doesn't mean the FBI doesn't still have the 
[57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3467) power to access those emails or listen to those calls if they want let me just again remind you that the US already shares unredacted raw metadata about American cens with an organization that 
[57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3477) has conducted more targeted assassinations than any other in modern world history it doesn't seem to particularly care about the bystanders they kill in the process just just worth 
[58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3486) noting just reminding you all of that also worth noting is that I very much want to continue this YouTube channel and continue uploading so if that were to stop for any 
[58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3498) reason and I know I focused a lot on critiquing Democrats here because you know they're in power but rest assured I know that this is going to get a whole lot worse with Trump to double the 
[58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3508) Tantrums probably embracing the more maskoff elements of this double standard Israel's the one that wants to go he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas actually Israel is the 
[58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3517) one and you should let him go and let him finish the job but make no mistake continuing the ethnic cleansing in Palestine is a bipartisan position they're at least profiting off of it is 
[58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3527) NCIS prepares its viewers to hear criticisms of Israeli geopolitical policy but still side with them or at least muddying the waters enough to inspire paralysis in the audience these 
[58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3538) criticisms are not substantive or impactful because they're still portrayed as better than the alternative rather it serves to whitewash their brutality not denying it but instead 
[59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3549) justifying it Zea is the sharp end of the spear it provides cover for people to either side with Israel or to claim a false sense of neutrality and I think that the way NCIS uses these double 
[59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3562) standards for Israeli intelligence and their enemies is emblematic of the way americ America at large has responded to the latest escalation in this conflict people will hide behind its complicated 
[59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3571) nature in order to draw some of the most insane comparisons I've ever read Pulitzer Prize winner and War on Terror apologist Thomas fredman recently wrote In The Seattle Times that quote I 
[59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3580) totally understand the distress coursing through these two communities Arab and Muslim Americans with friends and family in Gaza or Lebanon or the West Bank worry every day about loved ones being 
[59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3590) killed or wounded with us-made weapons that were transferred to Israel Jewish Americans have had to worry every day about their kids being exposed to left-wing anti-zionism on us college 
[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3604) campuses God on the one hand we you know we have people dying on the other hand some students were exposed to new ideas on college campuses that they didn't like those are the stakes we're talking 
[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtRDeopt40&t=3614) about while there is a near constant clamor for anyone asking for a ceasefire to also condemn Hamas Israel has been assassinating negotiation Partners all over the region from Ismail Han the lead
