## Ancient Relics
`dice:[[Pirate Borg Tables#^ancient-relics]]|Item`

Relics can be used to access ancient magical powers. Use your action to activate one in your possession.

After using a relic, test SPIRIT DR12. If you fail, you are stunned for the next round and that relic cannot be used until the next dawn.

On a Fumble, the relic is permanently destroyed or depleted, and then you lose d2 (`dice: d2`) HP. The GM decides the effect on a Crit, if any.

| 11        | The weather and time of day are immediately, completely different. You and everything within a 3 mile radius have traveled `4d12` hours into the future.                                                              |

| 17        | Your mind is lost at sea for what seems like 3d10 (`dice: 3d10`) years, yet no time has passed. Others watch as you age 3d10 (`dice: 3d10`) years in a matter of seconds.                                             |
| 18        | Hundreds of tiny crabs swarm you. They are harmless, and provide an extra -2 armor. They leave after d6 (`dice: d6` ) days, but return every full moon.                                                               |
