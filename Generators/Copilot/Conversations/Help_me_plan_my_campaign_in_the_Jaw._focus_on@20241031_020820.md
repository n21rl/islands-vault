[Timestamp: 2024/10/31 02:16:14]

**ai**: Planning the first session of your campaign in the Jaw, particularly focusing on how the players meet at the court of Maxitli, can set the tone for the entire adventure. Here's a detailed plan to help you get started:

### Setting the Scene

**Location**: The court of Maxitli, a prominent figure in Harboursjaw, known for his diplomatic skills and influence in both Steorrian and Selvean circles. The court is a blend of Steorrian sturdiness and Selvean elegance, with intricate tapestries and artifacts reflecting the province's rich history.

**Atmosphere**: The court is bustling with activity as various dignitaries, merchants, and adventurers gather to discuss the recent turmoil following the assassination of a Selvean official. The air is filled with tension and anticipation, as everyone is eager to see how the new political landscape will unfold.

### Introduction and Player Meeting

1. **Arrival at the Court**: Each player character receives an invitation to the court of Maxitli, either due to their reputation, connections, or a mysterious benefactor. This invitation hints at an opportunity to influence the future of the Jaw.

2. **Initial Impressions**: As the players arrive, describe the grandeur of the court and the diverse crowd present. Encourage players to share their characters' thoughts and feelings about being in such a politically charged environment.

3. **The Gathering**: Maxitli calls for a gathering in the main hall, where he addresses the crowd about the recent assassination and the need for unity and cooperation. This speech sets the stage for the players to understand the stakes and the importance of their roles.

### Player Interactions

1. **Introductions**: After the speech, Maxitli invites the players to introduce themselves to each other and the court. This is an opportunity for players to showcase their characters' backgrounds, motivations, and initial impressions of one another.

2. **Shared Objective**: Maxitli presents a task that requires a diverse group of individuals, hinting at the players' unique skills and backgrounds. This task could involve investigating the assassination, mediating between conflicting factions, or exploring a mysterious event affecting the province.

3. **Forming Alliances**: Encourage players to discuss their characters' motivations and potential alliances. Use the relationships list from the session zero checklist to inspire connections between characters, such as friendly rivals or fellow veterans.

### Initial Adventure Hook

1. **The First Challenge**: Introduce a minor conflict or challenge within the court, such as a heated debate between Steorrian and Selvean representatives or a sudden magical disturbance. This event serves as a catalyst for the players to work together and showcase their abilities.

2. **Decision Point**: Allow players to decide how they want to approach the challenge, whether through diplomacy, investigation, or direct action. This decision will set the tone for their roles in the campaign and their relationships with each other.

3. **Consequences and Opportunities**: Depending on the players' actions, provide immediate consequences that affect their standing in the court and open up new opportunities for adventure. This could include gaining a new ally, uncovering a clue about the assassination, or earning Maxitli's trust.

### Conclusion

Wrap up the session by highlighting the players' achievements and setting the stage for the next adventure. Emphasize the importance of their choices and how they will shape the future of the Jaw. Encourage players to reflect on their characters' relationships and motivations, setting the groundwork for deeper character development in future sessions.

By focusing on these elements, you can create a dynamic and engaging first session that immerses players in the rich world of the Jaw and sets the stage for a memorable campaign.

**ai**: To adjust the campaign plan for the first session in the Jaw, where the players meet at the court of Maxitli, and considering that the assassination hasn't happened yet, you can focus on setting the stage for the upcoming conflict and intrigue. Hereâ€™s a detailed approach:

### Setting the Scene

1. **Introduce Maxitli's Court**: Begin by describing the grandeur and political atmosphere of Maxitli's court. Highlight the tension in the air due to the recent political climate between Selvea and Steorr. This sets the tone for the players and immerses them in the setting.

2. **Establish Key NPCs**: Introduce important characters at the court, including Maxitli, who is the current leader advocating for peace. Present other influential figures who might have differing opinions on the Selvea-Steorr relations, hinting at potential allies or adversaries.

3. **Foreshadowing the Assassination**: Without revealing too much, drop subtle hints about the brewing conspiracy against Maxitli. This could be through overheard conversations, suspicious behavior from certain court members, or cryptic messages.

### Player Engagement

1. **Diplomatic Missions**: Assign the players roles as diplomats or envoys tasked with observing the court's proceedings or negotiating minor agreements. This involvement allows them to gather information and establish their presence in the political landscape.

2. **Investigative Opportunities**: Provide players with opportunities to investigate the court's dynamics. They might notice unusual security measures, secretive meetings, or receive anonymous tips about potential threats to Maxitli.

3. **Social Interactions**: Encourage players to interact with various NPCs, building relationships that could be crucial later. These interactions can reveal personal ambitions, alliances, and rivalries within the court.

### Plot Development

1. **Introduce a Minor Crisis**: Create a small crisis or event that requires immediate attention, such as a border skirmish or a diplomatic faux pas. This can serve as a precursor to the larger conflict and test the players' problem-solving skills.

2. **Espionage Elements**: Introduce elements of espionage, such as intercepted messages or a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows. This adds intrigue and sets the stage for the players to uncover the assassination plot.

3. **Moral Dilemmas**: Present the players with moral choices that reflect the campaign's themes, such as choosing between loyalty to Maxitli or personal gain. These decisions can have lasting impacts on their relationships and the unfolding narrative.

### Conclusion of the Session

1. **Cliffhanger Ending**: Conclude the session with a cliffhanger, such as a sudden announcement of a diplomatic envoy from Steorr arriving unexpectedly or a secret meeting being called by Maxitli. This builds anticipation for the next session.

2. **Character Development**: Allow players to reflect on their characters' motivations and alignments based on their experiences in the court. This can help them prepare for the upcoming challenges and deepen their engagement with the story.

By focusing on these elements, you can effectively set the stage for the assassination and the ensuing conflict, while providing players with a rich and engaging introduction to the campaign in the Jaw.

**user**: using [[07 - Session Zero Checklist]] please give details on how to run my specific session 0
[Timestamp: 2024/10/31 02:21:20]

**ai**: To run a session zero specifically tailored for your campaign in the Jaw, where the players meet at the court of Maxitli, you can follow these steps based on the [[07 - Session Zero Checklist]]:

### 1. Write a One-Page Guide
Create a concise one-page campaign guide for your players that includes:

- **Theme and Flavor**: Describe the Jaw as a province rich in history and cultural diversity, emphasizing the tension between the Steorrian settlers, Selvean newcomers, and indigenous Jaw people. Highlight the political intrigue and the potential for players to influence the region's future.
  
- **Unique Aspects**: Outline the "six truths" that make this campaign unique, such as the assassination of a Selvean official, the presence of diverse cultures, and the potential for diplomacy or conflict.

- **Character Fit**: Suggest character options that align with the campaign's themes, such as diplomats, adventurers, or peacekeepers. Discuss motivations that would drive characters to engage with the political and cultural dynamics of the Jaw.

- **Troubling Themes**: List any potentially sensitive themes, like colonialism or cultural conflict, and encourage players to discuss these with you.

- **Group Patron**: Introduce Maxitli as a potential group patron, a figure who can guide and support the players in their endeavors.

### 2. Describe the Theme
During session zero, gather your players and describe the campaign's theme, using the one-page guide as a reference. Emphasize the opportunity for players to shape the future of the Jaw through their actions and decisions.

### 3. Discuss Safety Tools
Address any potentially troubling themes and establish boundaries for content that should remain off-screen. Discuss safety tools that allow players to pause the game and address any discomfort with the campaign's themes.

### 4. Decide on a Group Patron
Present Maxitli as a potential group patron and discuss their role in the campaign. Encourage players to reach a consensus on whether Maxitli will serve as their primary quest giver, ensuring that all players are comfortable with this choice.

### 5. Build Characters Together
Collaborate with players to develop characters that fit the campaign's setting and themes. Encourage connections between characters, possibly using the provided relationship list for inspiration. Ensure that characters have motivations that align with the campaign's goals.

### 6. Run a Short Adventure
Conclude session zero with a short adventure set at the court of Maxitli. This could involve a diplomatic mission, a cultural festival, or a minor conflict that introduces players to the campaign's setting and dynamics. This adventure should be engaging and provide a taste of the challenges and opportunities the players will face.

By following these steps, you can create a session zero that effectively sets the stage for your campaign in the Jaw, ensuring that players are engaged and prepared for the adventures ahead.
