1. Create an encounter table appropriate for the context. 

2. Ensure a balance between combat encounters and non-combat situations. Not every encounter should lead to a fight.

3. Include a variety of encounter types: combat, role-playing opportunities, exploration scenarios, and situations that could be resolved in multiple ways depending on player choices.

4. Make the encounters feel like they're part of the world. They should reflect the unique aspects of the campaign setting.

5. Don't limit encounters to just enemies or combat. Include interesting events, NPCs, potential rewards, and environmental challenges.

6. Use a dice size (d8, d10, d12, etc.) as appropriate for the context

7. Create encounters that could go in several different directions based on how players choose to approach them.

8. Include a mix of straightforward encounters and more complex situations that might involve multiple elements (e.g., combat and role-play, or exploration and problem-solving).

9. Make sure the encounters provide opportunities for various skills and abilities to be useful, not just combat prowess.

10. Keep the descriptions concise but evocative, allowing for easy improvisation by the DM.
