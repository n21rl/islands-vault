Prompt: Create a table in Markdown of an appropriate number (up to 20) of appropriate items that might be found in the shop described in {{context}}. Please include columns for: Item Name, Cost, Description. The cost should be indicated in cp, sp, or gp. . Only include items from the official rules of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Please format the item name as a link to an existing D&D Beyond page by formatting it like this [item name](dndbeyond.com/equipment/ url). If there is no D&D Beyond page, do not invent one and simply give the name of the item. The description should be short and to the point. The items should be sorted by price.
